  Here's my Psycholonials Let's Play with commentary I did back in July, for the game's one year anniversary. Comes with screenshots and a transcript, so you can follow along.

    Psycholonials is an absolutely [i]bonkers[/i] game by Andrew Hussie. 

    Based on what I heard I thought Psycholonials would be interesting to react to (and boy was I right!) so I did a blind <span class="caps">LP</span> with commentary. In general, I think the music and art are good, but the story itself has… some issues. Interesting ones though, at least! Definitely a fun time.

    The captions and comments throughout the rest of this are a mixture of notes from my original blind playthrough and postcommentary to add details or references where relevant. 

    I know, there are dozens of Psycholonials playthroughs on YouTube already, but I still wanted to wait until the anniversary to give everyone who wanted to buy the game a chance to. But those aren’t accessible text, nor is the game, so this still seemed like a worthwhile exercise. [url=https://www.psycholonials.com/faq]For anybody worried about copyright, don’t be: according to the game’s <span class="caps">FAQ</span>, making an <span class="caps">LP</span> is actually explicitly encouraged.[/url]

    <span class="caps">N.B.</span> This was originally written in August of 2021, before [url=https://blog.giovanh.com/blog/2021/11/11/polygons-life-after-homestuck-thread/]Ana Diaz’s Interview[/url]

    Psycholonials. Andrew Hussie’s next [url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404204127/https://www.newsarama.com/39334-andrew-hussie-takes-homestuck-from-the-web-to-print-with-viz.html]keep making things[/url]. I’ve heard… shocking little about it, since it came out. Apparently it’s about clout, and the main character is bad? That’s most of what I know going in. Oh, and Clark Powell apparently composed the soundtrack! I’m a fan of theirs, so that should be fun.

    A while ago, I went through the first chapter of the game, but I mostly got distracted by technical details. I’m blind on the rest of the game, though. 

    Well, without further ado,

    <blockquote>
    Your name is Zhen. It’s pronounced more like Jen than Zen. But most people have been determined to mispronounce your name since elementary school. So at some point you decided to go by Z, and it stuck.

    Stuck it to your parents too, sorta, who endowed you with the romanization of a name which would either guarantee a lifetime of correcting people, or interminably acquiescing to their wrongness.

    You like Z better anyway because it’s yours, not theirs.

    It’s roughly 3:00 <span class="caps">PM</span>, and you have just woken up. Earlier than yesterday, so that’s a plus. And with a bit of a hangover, but that’s far from unusual.

    Your bedroom is a bit messy, but you don’t notice anymore.

    It’s a cozy little depression nest, and it serves its purpose well, which is to store the body of a depressed 23 year old woman when she’s not working, whilst the decor manages to accurately reflect her personality and emotional landscape.

    <blockquote>
    You’ve had this exact arrangement of posters taped to your wall since you moved here. Before that, actually. These posters were on the wall of your dorm in college, in this exact pattern. When the time came to make your desperate getaway from campus, you ripped it off your wall in one big taped-together mass, rolled it all up, and hit the road.

    Then when you got here, you simply unrolled it, and put it back up. Why mess with it?

    This particular hodgepodge of pop cultural nonsense says as much about yourself as you’d ever care to say using a wall.

    Maybe it’s a consequence of the media you consume that made you feel this way, but you’ve always believed you can tell a lot about a person by studying the things they used to like. In fact, you might even go as far as saying in this era, an individual’s personality isn’t much more than a composite of all the media they’ve ever consumed, and their favorite stuff in particular.

    That’s why whenever you meet someone new, you kind of wish you could just look at their bedroom and take a quick tour of all their interests, sparing you a lot of laborious banter and wondering over whether someone’s worth your time.

    Again, it could be certain types of content you’ve consumed in your past which resulted in this philosophy, but you can’t be sure. All you can do is refresh your memory on your various interests to reaffirm who you are to yourself, along with any imaginary voyeurs who have inexplicably decided to tune into your underwhelming morning ritual.

    </blockquote>
    So this is the format of the game. It’s a visual novel, but with drawn panels instead of sprites, and with powerpoint transitions between them. You can use the back arrow in the navigation to go back to the previous panel, but there’s no history view.

    I’ve spent some time trying to figure it out but I still have no idea what resolution the game is supposed to be run at. There’s no indication of a preset, or any graphical options. Internally the panels are a ludicrous 2048 pixels wide, although that seem to be after being incorrectly imported to Unity — more on that at the end.

    <blockquote>
    That’s your Metal Gear Solid poster. You have created a number of fanworks for this series, and not a single one of them is suitable for children. Very few are suitable for most adults, actually. But never mind that. You think Kojima has an advanced understanding of war which has eluded authors far more celebrated than he.

    You also think Kojima has an advanced understanding of horny gay men with enormous butts, which is an asset of far greater literary value in your opinion.

    Insane Clown Posse of course. You’re way out of this by now, but you had a juggalo phase in highschool. The reason for this decision was extraordinarily complex and layered. Far over the head of anyone who would ever be inclined to wonder. If you even need to ask why, being down with the clown cannot be fully explained. You mainly keep this up as a reminder of your roots.

    A reminder of a philosophy toward family which you prefer to more conventional definitions.

    This is right. The date is April 20, 2020. You guess you labeled a lot of these months in advance at the beginning of the year, when you were in higher spirits. A week ago was a day relevant to a childhood interest, so you facetiously drew a little doodle to commemorate. And today, of course, is weed day. Not that you actually smoke weed.

    Mostly on account of being too lazy to bother acquiring any. But that doesn’t mean the annual milestone shouldn’t be solemnly honored with the gravity of a religious holiday.

    As you stare at the calendar, you mostly just can’t believe it’s almost May already. Has it really been that long since you went to work? You guess that must be right. Early March was the last day the restaurant was open, and you’ve been holed up here ever since without pay.

    You’ve gotten by borrowing rent money from your friend Abby, who has also been shut in since the outbreak began. Not seeing her in months, not seeing anyone really, has had a very negative effect on your mental health. Probably the biggest reason you’ve been waking up so late these days.

    There’s a ton of computer equipment here lying dormant. It hasn’t been powered up in years, actually. Doing so would probably remind you of your college traumas.

    Sometimes you wonder if you will ever turn it on again.

    That’s probably for the best. Your hacking days are behind you. A lot of those old projects you were working on could have gotten you into some serious trouble.

    These days it’s all about cultivating your <span class="caps">BRAND</span>, although it hasn’t been going that well. More to the point, you’d probably be the first to admit your online brand is fairly shitty.

    But one has to start somewhere. Rebuilding a social media presence after a series of psychologically devastating catastrophes doesn’t happen overnight.

    You completed it just before the series of calamitous events leading to the aforementioned meltdown. You doubt this is a total coincidence, since as Abby likes to point out, only crazy people write manifestos. Which is more than a little hypocritical, since she’s been actively writing one herself.

    There’s no sugar coating it. Your tiktok is just plain weird. Full of avant garde shitposts of a humorous nature, usually performed in a completely deadpan manner, and with oblique intent to the average user of this platform. Sometimes you will knowingly post cringe. Always ironically though, which as far as you’re concerned, is dynamite content.

    Not many people understand it, though a handful of loyal simps in your follower list always seem to lap it up. Abby never misses an opportunity to reprimand you for your cringe posting. This is to be expected though. She’s a pro after all, and even you know your cringe posts are indefensible. That’s entirely the point.

The persecution for your past crimes is barely at a trickle now, which is a double edged sword.

    <blockquote>
    It’s been a few days since you posted any content. The fans are getting restless. Well, not really, but they are restless in your anxious imagination. You are just shy of 1000 followers.

    Maybe a new post will push it over the edge?

    Of course you understand the crowd isn’t that eager for more content.

    You know it’s a common affliction among aspiring influencers, the need to keep pushing content out of fear their followers will get bored.

    As if they’re a slobbering pack of wild dogs. Insatiable beasts who must have more, <span class="caps">MORE</span>. But you’re not an idiot, and you follow plenty of accounts too.

    And you know you could barely give a shit if even your favorite accounts stopped posting for a while. They can chill if they want? It simply would not affect your life.

    Your posting habits are more a matter of personal ethos. If you want to build a brand, the content must flow. And so you shall make it flow. But what to post? This as always is the burning question.

    On second thought, that idea barely even counts as a joke. Realistically, this meal belongs nowhere except a dumpster. The macaroni is practically inedible.

    You wonder how many members of this little flock happen to live here on the island? Probably nobody, since you have so few followers. You guess some of Abby’s followers might live here though. Actually, it’s more than likely. Since Abby lives here too, she’s probably got a few simps who are thrilled to be living on the same small island with such a sexy and popular influencer.

    <blockquote>
    Could the same basic principle apply to you on a smaller scale? Someone following you just because he happened to notice you’re local? Not out of the question. You linger on the idea.

    The 1000 people who follow you. They <span class="caps">LIKE</span> you, right? Ostensibly, this is why people follow each other. The hate which has chased you around has obscured this truth, but it seems likely this is how normal people operate. That’s kind of incredible for you to dwell on, that these people actually like you. Feels like a miracle that anyone would.

    You’re certain that this list overwhelmingly consists of cishet males. You wonder how many of them are attractive? Can’t possibly be more than a precious handful. You try to imagine these kings, these magnificent jewels in the rough.

    That they would bother following <span class="caps">YOU</span>, a complete loser and shithead with a bad attitude and even worse content, while they have the <span class="caps">AUDACITY</span> to be good looking, and probably sensitive and misunderstood.

    You realize you’re getting drunk enough to wonder if it’s a good idea to reach out to your followers through a story post to see if anyone’s nearby.

    Actually, that is not true. You don’t wonder if it’s a good idea. You’re perfectly aware it isn’t. What you mean is, you’re getting drunk enough to <span class="caps">KNOW</span> it’s a bad idea, but do it anyway. Why waste another second bullshitting yourself about it? You know you’re going to end up caving to yourself in the mental debate, so you cut to the chase and just do it.

    You prepare a cunning thirst trap, and post it to your story.

    Hang on. One guy here says he’s from Brookline, Massachusetts. That’s not far off actually. There’s something to work with here

    Much depends on how invested this guy is. Maybe you could rope him into coming to the island soon? Ferry schedules vary throughout the year, but there’s practically always one departing from Hyannis, which is probably about an hour’s drive from Brookline. Maybe he could even make the trip today if his desperation level is high enough.

    Why indeed.

    It’s an internally rhetorical question. Of course you would. Your thoughts turn again to your idol, dear, sweet Post. A complete swamp goblin of a man. And yet, if he were in your kitchen right now you have no doubt you’d ravage the poor fellow. He would probably be afraid of you. It would be better if he were afraid of you.

    Your secret wish is that one day you hope to strike sexual intimidation into the heart of an American singer-songwriter, rapper, record producer and actor, known for his introspective songwriting and laconic vocal style.

    Not that you would ever make such controversial remarks out loud. Not again, anyway. Not if you hope to have a <span class="caps">BRAND</span> some day.

    Fuck it, you say. You only get to ruin your life once. Or sometimes, many times in rapid succession. But if that’s the case, you like to think of it all as one long, grand act of ruination. And if you’re really committed to daisy-chaining a series of life-hobbling mistakes together, you might as well make it count.

    Psycholonials is written in Unity, apparently, using middleware called Naninovel. That surprises me, because so far everything seems like it could have been written in something like Ren’py or game maker. Unity seems like overkill for something as light as this, and ren’py is a solid <span class="caps">VN</span> engine that Andrew is already familiar with, having produced two full ren’py games already. 

    The various animations seem to have been originally written in flash, but they’re rendered as videos and just played as webms in-engine. 

    I get very distracted playing this game because the pixels are so wrong. All these scaled pixel art assets have anti-aliasing done on them, meaning the edges are at once blocky and blurry. It honestly gives me eye strain looking at it. I ended up running the game in a very small window for the <span class="caps">LP</span>, which helped a little. 

    Apparently, the [url=https://twitter.com/Skyplayer37/status/1366288002390003714]actual art assets in unity are aliased[/url], so it’s not an engine scaling issue, they were just imported wrong, in the equivalent of saving everything as a jpeg.

    Note: Most of the transitions in this game are jumpcuts or relatively slow fades, but these dream sequences have very slow fades. Unskippable, too, so it really forces the flow to slow down.

    <blockquote>
    That was a hell of a dream. You haven’t had one like that in years. Not since all that terrible stuff was happening in your life. Not since your dad was sick and you were deliriously hammering away at your manifesto. So it’s not surprising the dream included both. You hate dreaming about him. Always with the body horror shit.

    And then at the end. The strange man floating in space. The ephemeral muse himself. Could he really be back?

    You kill the video chat. It leaves a loud silence behind. Maybe it’s the sound of the “ominously humming well of satanic potential” you just described to your friend. A sound you can hear all the time, but only now are paying close attention to.

    Everything you said to her was true of course. You believe it with every fiber of your being. The internet is evil. You have always known this. And the louder the silence gets, the more you begin to wonder if it’s the only thing you’ve ever truly believed with any real passion.

    A number of familiar names there. Clark Powell, of course, [url=https://hsmusic.wiki/artist/clark-powell/]from the <span class="caps">HS</span> music team[/url]. Adelaide Killigan, who did development work on Pesterquest and Hiveswap Act 2, and works at [url=http://www.ratwormgames.com/the-sky-left-us.html]Ratworm Games[/url] with Aysha. Aysha, from the <span class="caps">HS</span> visual novels and [url=https://blog.giovanh.com/blog/2021/06/30/the-sarah-z-video-fallout/]her scandal[/url]. Andrew Kohi, who did extensive development work for Pesterquest, Homestuck^2, and Vast Error. And James Roach, from music. 

    Didn’t see [url=https://soundcloud.com/plazmataz/someday-feat-astro-kid]Astro Kid[/url] in those credits but it’s still pretty early in the game and I feel like I’ve made this point about crediting pretty thoroughly at this point so I’ll give you a mulligan. 

    You might have noticed that this game is published by The Silence Mill, everyone’s favourite game publisher. Probably yours too. Oh, it’s not? That’s because it isn’t real. The Silence Mill is a shell company that was cobbled together by Andrew Hussie on 7/2/20, just a few months before he released the first Psycholonials trailer. It’s incorporated in Delaware, for tax avoidance purposes. This is a favourite trick of Andrew’s, so much so that when I saw Andrew associated with a new company I just checked Delaware’s incorporation records and there it all was. It was actually set up by the incredibly fake sounding “[url=https://twitter.com/giovan_h/status/1356804005612167169]The Company Corporation[/url]“, which is a real company that helps people set up tax havens in Delaware. The Silence Mill does have [url=https://www.thesilencemill.com]a website[/url], which — unlike psycholonials.com — never got updated at any point, and still just has a youtube embed of the game trailer and nothing else, not even a store link. Anyway, the long and short of it is “The Silence Mill Inc.” is just Andrew self-publishing through yet another shell company he just set up. 

    Anyway, as for the menu, there’s also a chapter select here, but it has thumbnails which are spoilers. I have those thumbnails at the ends of chapters instead.

    so you just killed a cop, and dumped his car in the ocean. nice going genius

    the cold hand of justice will close around your throat soon enough. whatever it is that justice even means these days

    maybe justice is what happens whenever people with power manage to punish whoever was trying to fight back a little for once

    maybe thats why you need a little more power of your own. enough power to claim justice is whats happening when <span class="caps">YOURE</span> the one settling the score

    or maybe what you need is even simpler than that. maybe what you need is the power of <span class="caps">CHOICE</span>

    so what will you do, zhen? youre a fugitive now, and it seems only two choices are available

    >you can turn yourself in

    >or you can run. run like the wind and hide. find abby, dry yourself off, bury yourself in your work, and figure it all out later

    (You can also just hit the right arrow key instead of picking anything, and it’s the same.)

    Well, you thought they were sleepy at least. You guess all police forces in quiet summer colonies seem sleepy until the bullets start flying toward drunk girls armed to the teeth with manifestos.

    But that squad car surely had a dashboard camera, so you had to do something. What were you going to do, shoot the gas tank and blow up the car? That probably only works in movies.

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: im pretty sure my car was stolen today[/color]

    The dispatcher goes through the motions, asking for your name and other relevant information. No reason to hold anything back. You want them to know who you are, so they can rule you out when they find the body and the wreck. You then continue weaving your improvised story.

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yeah so, i think it might have been my abusive ex boyfriend?[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: hes been snooping around lately and he has a spare set of keys[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: uhhhhh[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: dont you have like[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: some witness protection shit i can do[/color]

    The dispatcher explains that isn’t really how that works. But they can send an officer over in the morning so you can file a police report.

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: oh wow[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: no i dont think, um[/color]

    You really need to end this call soon before the wheels completely fall off this attempted alibi.

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: to 911, or the police. how do i do that[/color]

    <blockquote>
    You can’t bring yourself to tell her yet. Tonight was too much. You just need an evening to unwind without making Abby freak out about your cop murder.

    You’re sure you’ll get around to telling her later, if you can think of the right way to break it to her.

    She’s been too good a friend to saddle her with the disastrous karma you can’t seem to avoid stockpiling.

    Or perhaps you aren’t stockpiling karma so much as dharma. Or maybe it’s some khaotic juxtaposition of the two concepts.

    Maybe you’ve been keymashing your whole way through life, and only now is your soul reaping the autocorrected consequences of this haphazard practice.

    Gotta ditch this. Hmm…

    You stash it in one of the bottom drawers, underneath some junk. She’ll probably never look in here. You guess you could have tossed the gun too. Sent it to a watery grave along with the squad car.

    But now you’re technically a fugitive. You trust the future even less than you did at the start of the day. There’s no guarantee you won’t need this again later.

    <blockquote>
    You didn’t ask for this shit. Yeah, you guess you shouldn’t have been driving drunk. But why should that mean you’re suddenly dodging bullets from one of <span class="caps">NPD</span>’s finest. Whatever, the pig is dead. But you know the matter isn’t done with you by a long shot. It’ll keep haunting you unless you start fighting back. This was the gift that departed officer gave you tonight.

    An albatross that’ll hang around your neck for the rest of your life. But you suddenly decide not to see it that way.

    The true gift he gave you was resolve. You’re so pissed about it, now you know you’re on the right track. Your ambivalence about rebooting your brand is completely gone now. In its place is the same rage and disgust which led you to write your manifesto in the first place.

    Rage and disgust for injustice, for the systemic evils of this nation, for the weakness and compliance which quell the righteous outrage of its citizens. And now, several years after its completion, there’s even more to be mad about. Persecution from the miserable wretches online who cancelled you. The ensuing mental breakdown which caused your life to spiral until you ended up on this island.

    </blockquote>
    I love the honesty in the narration here. Zhen isn’t really upset about systemic evils, she’s upset that people are mad at her online and a cop destroyed something important to [i]her.[/i] The worldview here starts from a completely self-centered space and expands the scope using whatever causes are convenient.

    <blockquote>
    And now on top of all that, an almost certain shitstorm brewing from law enforcement once they start piecing together what happened tonight.

    <blockquote>
    Well, they can do their worst. All the dirtbags out there can have at you soon enough, because you won’t be hiding for much longer. Your brand is about to get a very serious facelift. And once you step into the spotlight again, from now on people are going to find it a lot harder to ignore what you have to say.

    You and Abby have a lot of work to do tomorrow.

    <blockquote>
    Your name is Abby. It’s pronounced exactly as it’s spelled, so that’s made life pretty easy for you. Another thing that’s made life easy is the fact that your parents are rich.

    Rich doesn’t really do it justice though. Most people who vacation on this island for the summer are rich, relative to the average American citizen. Your parents are billionaires.

    And not the kind that barely qualify. One billion has ten digits. But they didn’t seem content to stop at ten, and society was more than happy to oblige.

    They own the house you live in, which represents a miniscule rounding error in the grand scheme of their total net worth.

    Easy to forget about most of the year, and they probably would, if you didn’t live here year-round. Growing up, you formed memories of this place strictly as a summer home.

    But after college, you decided to move in here permanently.

    Mostly because it keeps them out of your hair. It’s not the most convenient place to visit, so they never bother until the summer rolls around.

    And this year it’s looking more and more like the summer, as you once understood it, never will.

    <blockquote>
    It’s roughly 9:00 <span class="caps">AM</span>, and you have just woken up. Later than yesterday, but that’s okay. You were up late last night tending to your beleaguered friend, and even popular influencers need to sleep in sometimes. Your bedroom is tidy, and you always notice if it isn’t. You make sure to keep it that way to reflect well on your brand whenever this room is used as a backdrop for your content.

    Ordinarily you’d reach for your smartphone first thing in the morning, after an extensive routine of cooking breakfast, exercising, and feeding your beautiful horse. But <span class="caps">RIGHT</span> after all that, you go for your phone to check out the action surrounding your exceedingly well-trafficked accounts. But for whatever reason, today feels a little different.

    Instead, you decide to take in the environment. As a thoughtful influencer, you really can’t spend too much time tweaking the appearance of the lifestyle you sell to the adoring public.

    You get a little closer to a hanging graphic depicting your favorite boys. It’s hard to resist basking in their glow every now and then.

    <span class="caps">BTS</span> is an extremely popular k-pop group, and you are a vocal member of <span class="caps">ARMY</span>, which is what the fandom calls itself. You estimate you spend the majority of your waking hours contemplating these seven extraordinarily beautiful boys. Your bio says you’re bisexual, but you often like to joke in your posts that you like women, as well as exactly seven men, and that’s it.

    You are also an avid Jikook truther, which is to say, you strongly believe Jimin and Jungkook are secretly in love with each other. But you don’t consider this a theory, or even a particularly well kept secret. The evidence is overwhelming, and those who refuse to concede to these stone cold facts are blind, delusional charlatans.

    You’ve even written a manifesto on the subject, which as you’ve told Z before, is something only crazy people do. But you are the one exception to that rule, since when it comes to this subject, you aren’t crazy at all. Your eyes are <span class="caps">WIDE</span> <span class="caps">OPEN</span>.

    But when you’re not streaming, or doing yourself up for shoots, this here is the main reason you find yourself at this desk. You primarily use this laptop to write your fics. Lately it’s all <span class="caps">RPF</span> stories dedicated to exploring the alternate-universe lives of your seven favorite boys. Many of these fics get pretty racy. None of your fans have the slightest idea this is one of your hobbies.

    You keep a pretty tight lid on the habit since it’s frowned upon in many fandom circles, to say the least.

    Okay, the truth is you think you’d get crucified if it got out. But you’re not much like Z, and don’t throw caution to the wind as she has in the past. Your brand is a tight ship. Well, except when it comes to effusively sharing your sexual exploits with followers. In that sense it’s quite a loose ship. But when it comes to writing <span class="caps">FICTION</span>?

    That’s a whole different can of worms, and heads will understandably roll if the wrong types of online stories were to be associated with your name.

    <blockquote>
    There’s your horse. His name is David Hasselhoof. Your parents got him for you as a highschool graduation present when he was just a wobbly legged little colt. That makes him almost 10 years old now. When you graduated from Harvard, first thing you did was make plans to transport David to the island where you could reunite with him, and tend to him on your own in the summer home.

    He is by far your favorite family member. The very essence of quiet strength and loyalty.

    As for the silly name, it came with the horse. You had never even heard of David Hasselhoff before you got him. You assume it’s a pop cultural reference that boomers would get worked up about. But the way you saw it, who were you to fault them their pop references?

    God knows you’re prone to indulging in the references held dear by you and your peers, so you can’t possibly begrudge your elders the same simple joy. Besides, you thought the name was cute.

    The song [i]Together[/i] was originally the score to the 2013 independent short film [url=https://vimeo.com/70976988]High Tide[/url], which was released that same year as [url=https://hsmusic.wiki/album/someday/]Someday (feat. Astro Kid)[/url]. A number of other tracks from the Psycholonials <span class="caps">EP</span> came directly from Clark Powell’s [url=https://hsmusic.wiki/album/namesake/]Namesake[/url] (where [i]Together[/i] was re-released as [url=https://hsmusic.wiki/track/day-that-never-came/]Day that Never Came[/url]) or from unreleased <span class="caps">HS</span> music team WIPs. 

    At about that point in the paragraph, I started writing the sentence “It’s like Clark Powell’s megalovania” but then I died of a heart attack and thus could not finish that thought.

    As of the Psycholonials album release, those albums were deleted completely from Powell’s bandcamp page. Clark discussed a “cleanup” on twitter before the Psycholonials release, but has since deleted the tweet.

    However, since then (approximately November 2021) Clark has [url=https://clarkpowell.bandcamp.com/]re-listed his albums[/url].

    <blockquote>
    The day slips by as you monitor the comments and feedback on your humble starter post. The reception to your clownsona is almost universally positive.

    You can’t tell if it’s real praise, or if Abby’s followers are just being polite to her friend who’s an obvious charity case and just got a nice pity shoutout.

    It doesn’t matter though, because at the end of the day, clout is clout, and you have to start somewhere. You already have over 10,000 new followers, which seems like an absurdly high number to you.

    But when you consider you’re just siphoning off some of Abby’s following of 3 million, it’s just a tiny drop in the bucket.

    Still, it’s a strong start for only having posted a single clown selfie, and now it’s up to your showmanship to build on it.

    <blockquote>
    After seven days and nights of being supplied with a steady diet of fresh new simps due to Abby’s enthusiastic hype, combined with your newfound flare for social media ringmastering, your instagram following has ballooned to a figure you can barely comprehend. Just over half a million new subscribers.

    This total was unfathomable to you at one point, but you have to keep reminding yourself this is a modest fraction of Abby’s total fandom. They count as your fans too now, only by the promotion she has generously provided. The true test comes soon when you begin to flex your vision in front of a sizable starting crowd.

    You’ve begun releasing the introductory portions of your manifesto, which have been met with a largely positive reception, if somewhat confused as well.

    <blockquote>
    While your new fans appear to be humoring your dogmatic content, they mainly seem to be here for the novelty of your clowny e-girl stuff. You’re rolling in more simps than you know what to do with now. An almost limitless reservoir of thirsty boys would appear to be at your disposal for just about anything.

    Of course they’re mostly all the same eager simps who’ve been hounding after Abby for years, who seem more than willing to migrate to a greener, clownier pasture.

    And of course, as expected, a few old antis have begun to surface as well. And they brought receipts. You knew they would. You simply delete some of the comments containing links to your previously problematic behavior, block, and move on. Their negativity is overwhelmingly drowned out by other more positive comments regardless.

    This is a relief to see, and it helps you rise above the hate.

    I wonder if we’re ever actually going to learn what Zhen did in the past that was so “problematic” it’s still haunting her? Was it actually something bad (like additional murders), or some internet drama? Because that matters. Or are we never going to learn that because Andrew wants to make a statement about cancel culture in the abstract? Anyway, antis.

Wild swings in their total net worth to the tune of billions. Their money people must have been moving the assets around like crazy to protect what’s left.

    It’s hard to pin down their total net worth given the complexity of the holdings, but your recent estimates have it somewhere between 20 and 30 billion dollars. But probably not for long, depending on the economy of course, as well as what you and Abby can manage to put into motion with your revolutionary new philosophy known as pranxis.

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Yeah[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: So i started babbling about bitcoin shit again, per your notes[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: its like 90% social engineering[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: you need to be patient, plant all these seeds along the way, set up points of psychological leverage[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Lol i bet you have[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Oh my god[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: for the service i want them to be using of course. its a real service. deals in high volume crypto transactions[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: the point is to get them to do real shit first, then get tricky with it a little later[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Okay[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: ive also been emailing them shit that looks legit enough. kinda bombarding them with info[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: offhand testimony from trusted people, other rich fucks spooked about the economy, and now youre one of the human levers too[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: when the time comes youre the one who pushes them to make the final move[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Who are the “trusted people”[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i mean, theyre fake. its all just me[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i started a few fake chain emails. you know the ones boomers love to reply to and forward around. its like catnip, they cant fuckin help themselves[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: put a ton of crap email addresses in the recipient field, including a bunch from people i know theyre acquaintances with. nobody <span class="caps">TOO</span> close, but names of other rich people theyd recognize and listen to if they saw them babbling about crypto as a way to protect their billions in a dumb email chain[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Wow…[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i actually did this on a whim, being skeptical of the returns but its been working phenomenally[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i got your mom to reply to one of these chains a few times credulously[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i worked her a little bit with one of the sockpuppets, some other rich dude shes met. its so easy to get these names. the republican donor lists are kind of a goldmine[/color]

    One of the reasons I decided to look through Psycholonials in the first place is… well, that the author is wealthy. 
    Even before Homestuck, Andrew came from a rich family with serious monetizable patents. Like, he has [i]capital[/i] capital. 
    That’s one of the things that’s always made his whole juggaloo thing a little odd. Like, that’s a community that’s deeply rooted in working-class-to-poverty culture. You don’t typically see wealthy white men coming in. I mean, I’m no expert (juggalologist), but it strikes this casual observer as odd. 
    So when I heard someone coming from that position wrote a political story that touched heavily on themes of modern wealth and class conflict. I was interested in seeing how he was going to portray that dynamic. 
    And here it is, I guess.

    You can play and pause these video dealies with the on-screen controls. There’s no way to seek them, though. You can skip them if you click the fast-forward button in the bottom-right.

    Another week slips by like it’s nothing. The passage of time is helpless against the momentum of your brand. The march toward one million followers is as inexorable as it is captivating.

    Even Abby with her vast following is taken aback by your rapid rise. You may have captured lightning in a bottle, which is hard to explain. Could it be the intrinsic allure of clowns? The socialist demagoguery? Your unique flavor of showmanship, or your ability to manipulate discourse and controversy to your benefit?

    Is it still just a matter of riding Abby’s multi-million follower coattails? Or maybe it’s just plain pandemic-driven boredom juicing the numbers. No one seems to have the answer, but it’s hard to argue with the results.

    Few have taken to the Jubilite lifestyle with more gusto than Abby herself. In the previous week she has unveiled her new clownsona to uproarious acclaim. Abblepie is a hit, and her clownsona posts are getting higher levels of engagement than even she’s used to.

    Something peculiar is going on which wasn’t supposed to happen. Her following is spiking right along with yours. She began at around three million, and now it’s sitting at three and a half. There’s unanticipated synergy between your two brands, which lends something to the claim that you aren’t just coasting off her clout anymore. She’s starting to get a boost from yours as well.

    Now that she’s figured out radical clown energy is nearly as good for business as fashionably stanning certain kpop groups, she continues hyping your brand with all the more enthusiasm.

    <blockquote>
    Your public lessons on pranxis are a hit as well. Stories of the fandom’s implementation of these ideas have begun to circulate, which is becoming a form of content unto itself. Abby’s been doing a masterful job of convincing her parents it’s all just part of their ploy to own the gullible libs, drive clicks and take their money.

    Anyone eavesdropping on her calls with her parents now would be hard pressed to tell her apart from a staunch republican. She gives all credit to her mom and dad for training her too well on how to sound like them.

    Everything is further complicated by the fact that you need to keep a low profile. You set up a streaming studio in the other wing of Abby’s house, never doing anything to indicate the two of you are in the same building. You don’t even use her wifi, in case they get clever and subpoena instagram for tracing purposes, or whatever it is they can do.

    So, let’s talk xenogenders. Actually, no, let’s not; I for one feel woefully underqualified to touch on that. 

    I will instead just point out that [url=https://uncommongenders.home.blog/2018/04/23/clowngender/]clowngender[/url] is apparently already a thing, and not something Andrew Hussie invented. It’s also not very much like the gender Zhen describes here. What she describes — “[ressonating less] with the entire concept of gender at all, like youre transcending the entire conventional spectrum, and seeing gender for the farcical social construct it really is” — is [url=https://agender.info]Agender[/url], another thing Psycholonials did not invent.

    I realize I’m being a little hard on the author here. I guess I take issue with this to the degree that the game thinks it’s inventing something new and profound, which is what I’m interpreting it as doing. If it doesn’t mean to be doing that, then that bothers me less.

    Also, putting nonbinary as the dead center of the male/female axis and calling that understanding “standard” is… whew, that’s [i]super[/i] wrong, right there. Whether it’s Zhen or the author who’s getting it wrong, I don’t know, but that ain’t it.

    <blockquote>
    You open your previous <span class="caps">DM</span> with Percy and pick up where you left off with your drunken conversation, like barely a day has gone by. This time you make sure your flirtation is considerably less hostile, which he appears to appreciate.

    He’s more than appreciative, actually. His instincts as a devoted simp seem to be in overdrive now, considering how much clout you’ve accumulated since you last spoke. He must feel quite special, given that he had a chance to speak with you when you only had a meager following of a thousand people.

    This special feeling of elite, ground floor access to you is a factor you can easily work to your advantage. By now, you doubt there’s much you could ask of him that he wouldn’t leap at the opportunity to help you with. And as a dedicated fan of your content, he should be more than thrilled to participate in a scheme which is such a quintessential act of pranxis.

    You consider how many simps would kill for a chance to be in his shoes.

    Or if not literally commit a murder, then to at least be framed for one.

    You decide not to mention your troubles with the law just yet, let alone the fact that you arbitrarily decided to implicate him in the slaying of a police officer. That would really kill the mood. It could also overwhelm him, when you really need his wits as sharp as possible, so he can play the role of a wealthy suitor to a middle-aged billionaire woman.

    After all the flirtatious pleasantries are over, you and Abby retire to the living room as you continue walking him through the play.

    I don’t know what Zhen’s whole thing with burning money is about. Something about disrespecting the weight capitalist society gives to expensive luxuries? Part of her political praxis? Personally, in real life, I see having enormous amounts of money and wasting it on personal expression while others are suffering from poverty as a bad thing. The kind of thing that makes billionaires bad. Because billionares are bad for reasons that directly relate to the things they choose to be and do, and not just because of the label. That whole thing.

    I honestly love how the art in Psycholonials plays with resolution. The mixed pixel resolution ([url=https://indiehellzone.com/2021/11/29/psycholonials-part-3-sword-and-crown/#:~:text=chump%20on%20the-,mixels%20,-(%3C-%20really%20funny%20phrase)]mixels?[/url] are actually a very expressive tool. You’ll commonly see things like that last panel, where the body is low-resolution and upscaled without any filtering, and then the face is drawn on at another scale. It’s actually really charming, and it allows for things like that Percy panel, where the face is comically simplified, to work naturally within the artstyle.

    Since you relaunched your brand, never in your wildest dreams did you imagine having more followers than Abby, let alone leapfrogging over her so quickly. Her following has been ticking up steadily too, but it’s nothing compared to the rate of your fandom’s growth.

    You are the star of this circus, and now even Abby’s fanbase has to admit she’s become a close-orbiting satellite to your brand, rather than the other way around, as it once was.

    Something about the chaotic energy of the Jubilite craze, combined with the drama of the dead cop scandal has resulted in transforming your social media presence into phenomenon status. The media has become obsessed. It’s fascinating to many for its unusual and incendiary ideological focus, and just as captivating to others for resembling a slow-motion train wreck.

    There is a sense among your millions of new followers that the more sensational, criminal elements surrounding the daily drama of your brand will only get worse, and people are here for it.

    <blockquote>
    You adamantly deny the accusations, of course, and expertly weave these denunciations into your performance to magnify the attention to your accounts.

    Since the natural targets of your screeds are the corrupt government, corporations, and the police forces around the nation which only serve to protect their power and wealth, it’s been pretty easy to conjure a narrative framing these accusations as an attempt by powerful forces to silence you.

    By the looks of it, most of your followers are willing to believe your denunciations, and not many of them were big fans of law enforcement to begin with anyway. It’s just more fuel for your showmanship, a story that’s easy to sell to a hungry crowd. Almost as easy to sell as Abby’s parents have been on your recent pranxis efforts.

    On that front, it’s been like shooting fish in a barrel. Abby has her dad deeply concerned about market volatility, and selling off huge amounts of stock to buy bitcoin, which he then enthusiastically funnels into your spoof wallet.

    You and Percy have been working her mom, who’s been doing the same thing with a totally separate spoof wallet unbeknownst to her husband, in anticipation of carving out a portion of their assets which she can make off with after the imminent divorce. Every time they make new deposits, you’re sure to quickly reroute those funds to offshore accounts under your control.

    Meanwhile you maintain fake back end sites for them to look at, which makes it appear their deposits are still secure. They’re both so caught up in the process, it hasn’t even occurred to them to wonder if they’re being robbed.

    Percy’s been an invaluable accessory to the ruse. He now needs minimal instruction to play the role of her mom’s lover. They exchange racy photos and sext messages frequently between their phone calls. You’ve had a lot of fun photoshopping the head of the man she believes she’s talking to onto body shots sourced from amateur porn.

    You get some pretty steamy pics back from her in return, but you spare Abby the trauma of sharing those with her.

    Percy has made plans to come to the island tomorrow to help out with some new projects you’re working on. Having another set of hands will be helpful as you move into more ambitious phases of your brand’s development, especially while you’re trying to keep a low profile. Of course, it’s nagging at you that the police have his photo. You still haven’t told him.

    You just can’t seem to find the right moment. It would be such a downer having to explain something like that when you’re both having such a good time swindling billionaires.

    All your stuff, your beloved posters, liquor bottles and nasty macaroni pots, it’s all probably in an evidence room somewhere by now. You never liked the place much, but it’s still sad to think that chapter of your life is over for good.

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: as you can see, the pyramid shaped continuum remains intact[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: but the y axis has been expanded to go even lower[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: which means that while horizontally we have the conventional male-female gender binary[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: <span class="caps">VERTICALLY</span> we now also have the clown-horse gender binary[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: both binaries are of course a fluid spectrum, and you can position yourself anywhere on this continuum that feels true to your experience[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: so whats horse gender?? glad you asked[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: it represents the extreme counterpoint to clown gender[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: where clown gender embodies a whimsical, absolute lack of identification with the conventional gender spectrum, or even the entire idea of gender…[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: horse gender is the total opposite[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: it means <span class="caps">EXTREME</span> identification with any given gender on the horizontal axis![/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: so if youre a horse gendered male, it means youre saying you feel <span class="caps">EXTREMELY</span> male[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: or if youre a horse gendered woman youre like. god <span class="caps">DAMN</span> am i a fucking woman[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: terfs??[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i mean dont take that too literally. i dont want to taint horse gender for everybody right out of the gate[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: you could also be hella woman identified without being weird and terfy about it, and that would still be a totally valid horse gender feeling[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: move down toward horse, and youre digging in. where clown is a symbol of whimsy, horse is a symbol of <span class="caps">STRENGTH</span>! youre like <span class="caps">HELL</span> yeah im this fucking gender, and <span class="caps">THATS</span> <span class="caps">COOL</span>[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: and theres nothin wrong with that? the system accounts for it. all points on this continuum are equally valid[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: and notice in the middle of the scale vertically, between horse and clown? thats just the “average” gender spectrum. thats where you are if you dont feel super strong or weak about your identity either way. and if thats you??[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: <span class="caps">ALSO</span> <span class="caps">FUCKING</span> <span class="caps">VALID</span>[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: so having said that, allow me to illustrate some examples of putting this into practice, as i see it[/color]

    <blockquote>
    You check your phone, and notice the date happens to be the 20th of May. Exactly one month since the night you went on that fateful drive with your manifesto. Today, Percy is scheduled to arrive so he can assist with new projects. You wait for his ferry from inside the Bentley, parked at a distance to stay out of sight. You haven’t been here since the night you disposed of the squad car.

    You find yourself glancing in that direction now and then. You have no idea if they dredged the car out of the water yet, or if they even figured out that’s where it ended up.

    That incriminating dashboard camera footage was probably completely wiped out after being submerged in salt water for weeks. You guess you’re relieved about that, but then, with the amount of hysteria there is about this case in the media, that footage hardly seems to matter anymore. You’re who they’re looking for, and nothing can change that.

    All you can really do now is make sure you don’t get caught.

    zhen you idiot, you’re a billionaire. there are so many things you could be doing that aren’t this. i know I’m supposed to say this girl needs therapy but maybe therapy isn’t for you. maybe just go to prison

    It’s interesting how this story revolves around this political ideology that the player knows so little directly about. It’s defined in a manifesto that was published in-universe, but which the player has not been shown. 

    The ideology itself seems to be “society is bad, do whatever crimes you want, I was mad anyway.” It’s almost South Park-esque in how much it romanticises applied apathy and the pursuit of… what? Money, followers? A bunch of instrumental goods that just sit in a hoard and aren’t being used for [i]anything[/i], good [i]or[/i] bad. And with how willing she is to rope other people in and casually destroy their lives, it’s obvious there’s no room here for any actual respect towards others. Zhen says she has these long-term goals, but if she did she wouldn’t be taking these absurd, suicidal risks. 

    I don’t know if this was the intended read, or if the authors really [url=https://homestuck2.com/bonus/a-treatise-on-representational-democracy/13]thought they had come up with something deep and meaningful even though it’s obviously terrible if you think about it for even a minute.[/url]

    I wonder if there are zhen did nothing wrong stans out there, somehow. Probably not, because this game did not sell well.

    Is this just becoming reverse fight club now? Because that could actually be awesome.

    You couldn’t go back to Abby’s house after your second and third cop murders of the year. And Abby couldn’t exactly stay where she was either.

    The police would surely be knocking on her door again soon, especially considering it was her Bentley which was used to ram the car of the slain officers.

    So you rented an airbnb close to your old restaurant and walked there once it was dark.

    Abby drove to meet you at the house, which is where you’re all staying now until you can think of a better plan.

    It’s so interesting how the narrative is framing this as an anti-cop story even though it clearly isn’t. Zhen got blind drunk, only got pulled over [i]after[/i] crashing her car into somebody’s fence, tackled a cop who hadn’t shot at her or done anything but hold a gun (and, let’s be frank, it turns out Zhen is the kind of person you really do need to keep at gunpoint), murdered the cop in cold blood (not self defense!) and then went on to kill, like, two other police officers unprovoked. I mean, it’s really not hard to write a good anti-cop story, don’t get me wrong. It’s just that this one very clearly isn’t. Even compared to the cops, Zhen is absolutely the monster here, and that’s really saying something.

    A place that can facilitate boating activity in a way that’s much more discreet than anything going on by the docks near the downtown area.>

    A few times Percy attempts some smalltalk. You humor him, nodding along, occasionally turning your head to throw him a smile. Seems like he’s skirting the topic of… his feelings? Something like that. That’s nice, Purse. You’re super flattered and all, but it would behoove him to come to grips with the magnitude of what’s about to take place on this island.

    In the not too distant future, some very loud noises may be assailing his ears. But they won’t be coming from wedding bells.

    You study his reaction as he connects the dots. Of course he knows what’s going on now that he’s seeing their reactions. Not to him, but you. They’re all looking awestruck as you approach.

    He must realize now these are guys you invited to the island, just like him. But they didn’t come by ferry. They arranged their own transport via privately owned boats.

    You say nothing for a moment, taking it all in. You bask in the hushed reverence. Their disposition is becoming quite familiar to you. Just another bunch of simps for your collection.

    Ones with completely different utility than Percy. Ones that aren’t nearly as soft. You begin eyeing some of the hardware they brought.>

    But the intensification of recent events hardly has been limited to circumstances on the island. The entire country has suddenly ignited in civil unrest over police brutality, and the extrajudicial murders of Black people at the hands of law enforcement. Something is stirring in America.

    It’s as if the more comfortable parts of the nation decided to finally wake up to the fact that they’ve been living in a police state for longer than most previously cared to admit.

    But you’ve noticed another development cropping up alongside this wave of righteous political action. Leeching off the roiling energy of the nation, Jubilites have begun their own gatherings in huge numbers.

    At first no one thinks much of another few gangs of painted buffoons slipped in between the garish Trump motorcades and doomed boat parades, but before you know it, you can barely point a camera anywhere without televising another preposterous gaggle of circus riffraff clowned up behind their masks.

    Certainly too many clowns for the comfort of corporate media, but if you’re being honest, maybe too many for yours as well. You begin to wonder what you’ve unleashed upon the nation.

    <blockquote>
    Quickly, social media seemed to realize that this was a different flavor of political action. The sheer number of clowns with guns roaming the streets are making the people with all the money and power very nervous. Like maybe the usual methods of media propaganda aimed at subduing these movements won’t work on this crowd.

    There is a sense that once the clowns are out of the barn, closing the door won’t do much good.

    <blockquote>
    And maybe there’s something to it. As the police escalated their violent brutality in retaliation to the unrest, the Jubilites seized upon the chaos. Once they saw it was possible to drive police out of an area by force, they grew bolder in their aggression. No longer were your clowns an aimless gathering of oddities, a sideshow of loitering farceurs.

    They were hijacking the political atmosphere toward their own objectives, and in turn, yours.

    The spectacle of it drew even more people in, who would begin wearing the paint. And the more painted faces showed up, the more your movement appeared to stake its claim as a force entirely distinct from the origins of the civil unrest. A force now taking the momentum of your once modest social media campaign, and flooring it.

    It now looks like police precincts everywhere may start falling like dominoes, and you see no reason to tell your people to take their huge floppy shoes off the gas pedal.

    You don’t really associate the death of parents with grief or loss anymore. That was just another one of society’s lies, that these were things you were supposed to feel.

    That’s how it was with your dad, watching him slip away slowly. The feeling of initial sadness for him gradually twisted into something that was nothing like sadness at all. More like a screaming inside that got louder every day. You watched his desperation grow as he knew the end was near.

    He was being devoured in his final days by the feeling that he wasn’t given nearly enough time on Earth. He fell so far short of turning his life into the thing he once imagined it would be, and the result of staring into this abyss was utter panic. And where does all that panic go? Who feels the blame, the sense of accusation, the demented rage over the unfairness of it all? It was you.

    Your true inheritance is this tortured understanding, an implied contract since the day of your birth, that you will be all that remains of his legacy. That now it’s up to you to bring meaning through familial continuity into a life he just went to painful lengths to make clear he barely even considered worth living himself.

    But you had no intention of honoring that inheritance. The contract was worthless, partly because you never agreed to it. But more importantly, you gained disturbing insight into its author in the process of watching him die. You didn’t lose respect for him, it was somehow worse than that. You began to question his agency as a human being. You questioned his humanity itself.

    As the sickness tore away at him, it took little bits of his mind along the way. Your father’s intellect and personality were being dismantled in such alarming ways, you began to wonder if you even knew what a human being was anymore.

    <blockquote>
    The panic begins with a trickle. But once the media starts running the footage, it turns into a flood. Creating a stampede of people trying to leave the island all at once ordinarily would be irresponsible, you think. It would be if you didn’t have a transportation plan ready to go, which, of course you do. If there’s one thing you and your simp army isn’t short on, it’s boats.

    All the boats that brought them here, plus a whole lot more which were idle in ports waiting to be repurposed, are at the ready for the surge of frightened locals. Your teams take charge, yelling at the crowds which way to go. They load, cast off, and when they drop them at the mainland, the empty boats will just turn around and head back for more.

    The whole fleet will keep at it, all night long if needed, until the island holds no one who wants to leave.

    As chaos swirls around the media in response to this attack, there are real questions about what actually happened, even as everyone flees in desperation just to be safe. Questions about who was responsible for the attack, whether it was even real, and why approximately forty police officers were slaughtered in a shootout just as the attack began.

    You announce to the world that federal authorities appear to have deployed a vicious biochemical attack intended to target you and the members of your movement which have been organizing on this island. They’ve seen how dangerous the Jubilites have been to the stability of state and corporate power, and they decided to crush the opposition at its source.

    But you and your most loyal supporters survived, retreating into shelters until the attack subsides. You go on to urge any civilians who haven’t evacuated yet to leave for their own safety. You seize upon the moment to swear vengeance on the state which committed this atrocity to continue escalating the many pockets of insurgency already boiling over across the country.

    No reason to waste an opportunity to continue taking the fight to them. Over the last week of riots, you’ve seen state power bleed. And as long as there’s blood in the water, you might as well release your sharks.

    So there are a lot of specific historical events from 2020 being referenced here. Obviously Covid, but also the mass protests against police brutality following the murder of George Floyd, and specifically the occupation of Seattle dubbed the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (<span class="caps">CHAZ</span>) in June. The idea, basically, was to cut off police presence in the area entirely, and show that the community could support itself and thrive without a militant police presence.

    Wrapped up in the real-life discourse around protesting was this concept of “outside agitators”. This is rhetoric used to discredit political unrest by saying the actors came from “outside” — either from outside the affected community, or physically foreign agents — and the visible unrest doesn’t represent any legitimate grievances of the people. 

    Notably, in real life, there was actual police brutality, and the “outside agitators” narrative was a false one. There were actual atrocities being protested, instead of just people who got angry on the internet. Psycholonials has yet to directly touch on the former, other than just saying it’s the case; ascribing adjectives to it through the lens of Zhen’s narration.

    Also, unlike what happened the actual capital hill autonomous zone, there is zero mutual aid or any sort of community support on Clown Island. In the absense of anything to suggest otherwise, it seems like it’s every clown for themself, with nothing resembling production, sustainability, or support. Again, just no community. It is, again, the kind of militaristic anarchy fantasy you would expect to see a villain of a story execute.

    Maybe Psycholonials is a lesson in the importance of not organizing your social movement around unstable people whose primary motivations is their personal frustrations and fame. That could be a good lesson: “hey, don’t base your important social movement around Instagram influencers.” I could get behind that.

    <blockquote>
    Evacuation of the island was chaotic, but swift. Terrified locals stormed the docks, pushing each other closer and closer to the water, but mindful not to tip each other in.

    They’re polite people, decent enough, you always thought.

    None terribly deserving of being forced to become a prisoner to a seceding summer colony, which is why you went to so much trouble to orchestrate a well-oiled evacuation machine.

    <blockquote>
    All told, the vast majority of the evacuation took only a few hours. By the time the sun was setting and boats were returning from their round trips, only a handful of people still waited on the piers. And when boats came back from their dropoffs, many of the waiting locals were a little puzzled to find that the boats weren’t returning empty.

    They were always filled with new groups of well-armed people, jumping onto the docks with gusto and scattering into the neighborhoods and disappearing. Not running away from the danger, but right into it.

    With every boatful of locals dropped off at the Massachusetts shore, your people always had another squad of recruits from the mainland ready to jump onboard and head to the island.

    It continued on like this for hours, back and forth across the sound. Where the population at the beginning of the day was around 10,000, the final headcount after a near-total evacuation was 13,000. Your false flag maneuver simply replaced the entire population of the island with rabid Jubilites, and then some.

    <blockquote>
    The new recruits remained faithful that the crisis posed no danger to them, and was merely a powerful act of pranxis. And they would keep coming well after the evacuation, too. There was no need to bother with the pretense of renting airbnbs anymore, or keeping a low profile.

    The new residents of the island began occupying the houses vacated by locals, along with the large supply of empty summer homes. No form of authority existed to stop you anymore. Collectively, all of you <span class="caps">ARE</span> the authority.

    The only thing left to do is wait and see how this authority will be challenged by the government once it comes to grips with how badly it just got bamboozled. But in the meantime, not even your most cynical antis can dispute the obvious. This island now belongs to you.

    You walk away feeling relieved of administrative responsibility, only to realize you now have time to dwell on all your other problems. You are terrified that your friend won’t recover from her critical condition. And no matter how successful her subordinates are, you doubt you’ll ever be able to shake the feeling that this island could be invaded by the military at any moment.

    Your parents are pissed, not only at your involvement in the secession of their favorite summer colony, but they now realize they’ve been played as well. Your mother has caught on to the fact that she was being scammed by her lover, and your father seems to understand you’ve been playing him for the fool as well. They want their money back, but obviously that’s not going to happen.

    You’ll have to think about how to play it. You don’t think your mom knows she was being catfished by Z and Percy. Maybe you can try to convince your dad that you were sincere about the bitcoin stuff, but you were being scammed by the same guy that your mom was. That seems like a plausible out, but it would just involve more lying, and maybe it’s not even worth it anymore.

    Maybe Z was right, and you’re better off just giving up on the idea that parents like this are worth having any relationship with at all.

    You take another look at the news. It’s pure madness. You and Z are everywhere you look when it comes to trending topics online and coverage of recent events. The upheaval around the country is accelerating, and all the footage you can find now features way, way too many clowns in the gatherings for your comfort.

    No matter which media outlet you turn to, it always seems they’d rather point their cameras at a bunch of unruly clowns than focus on the real issues originally propelling the civil unrest.

    And yet, it’s hard to deny that the gradually coalescing rhetorical message of this clown ruckus ties into Z’s political agenda, which she so assiduously itemized in her manifesto.

    This movement which once seemed nothing more than a bunch of anarchist jesters opportunistically making mischief now more closely represents open revolt against capitalist and imperialist state power.

    <blockquote>
    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: As Secretary Abby has already touched upon, your evacuation strategy has been an overwhelming success. Virtually all locals have been displaced from the island due to your brilliant and daring act of pranxis, and have been replaced with tens of thousands of Jubilite loyalists.[/color]

    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: While the media debated whether or not it was a hoax, we made sure to secure the island. We’ve taken over all major facilities with a militia presence, including the airport.[/color]
    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: We’ve also promoted the claim that there are now thousands of bombs deployed all over the island, rigged to detonate if the government ever reclaims the territory.[/color]

    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: So they’re free to try if they like! :) But the consequence will simply be the total obliteration of all this valuable property they are claiming we have stolen.[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yeah i heard about the bombs[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: they hit that part of the story a lot in the media[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: it was a nice touch[/color]
    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: <span class="caps">THANK</span> you, sir!! I mean, Z!! :) It was my idea. :)[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: but there arent any actual bombs are there[/color]

    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: Oh, there are a bunch of real bombs for sure. For the sake of taking photographs to prove it isn’t completely made up, as well as for detonating a few of them as a warning, if it ever comes to that.[/color]
    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: But yes, you are right. There are far from thousands. :)[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: well thats good to fuckin know[/color]

    <blockquote>
    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: Meanwhile, the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> military presence has been increasing. A fleet of navy ships has amassed around the island, presumably to function as a blockade, preventing more ships from arriving.[/color]
    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: This has stemmed the flow of new recruits coming in, but more importantly, it’s resulted in an unofficial embargo.[/color]

    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: Soon we’ll need to consider how to cope with supply shortages, unless we can figure out how to disrupt the blockade.[/color]

    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: As our Secretary mentioned, we had that unfortunate power disruption. Electricity as I’m sure you know is not generated locally on this island. It’s supplied from the mainland through two underwater cables, regrettably putting us at the mercy of whatever the energy company decides to do. Or worse, what federal authorities talk them into doing.[/color]

    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: So, as the textbook maneuver goes when it comes to any hostage crisis, which the feds are <span class="caps">SURELY</span> viewing this as, albeit on a much larger scale, they attempted to shut off the power.[/color]

    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: People on the island were understandably quite upset! So Secretary Abby kindly put out a distress call, and the backlash by our fellow Jubilites was rather intense, to say the least.[/color]

    [color=#ff3037]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: Many forms of pressure were put on the energy company, until they relented and restored power to the island.[/color]

It turns out our movement may have more leverage upon such institutions than even most government agencies do.[/color]

    This story about systematic oppression would really, [i]really[/i] hit better if it demonstrated the existence of any.

    Really, more than anything, this is a great story about the dangers of cult mentality, although I don’t think it means to be. Like, this is a great dive into cult behaviour and some of the serious issues we’re running into today in the real political landscape about rallying behind charismatic figureheads, but I don’t think that’s what Andrew’s going for. 

    See, the trouble is, I want to assume that all these horrific things are [i]meant[/i] to be bad, but given that Andrew’s friends have already just out-and-out publicly advocated for public lynchings of people they wanted to cancel online, maybe not? Based on the text so far and the context of the writing I really do think the author actually thinks they came up with a neat cult.

    After another month is swallowed into the dystopian 2020 abyss, the march toward social media supremacy continues unabated. Last week, you leapfrogged over Katy Perry. Today, you just slid past Miley Cyrus. Both accounts took seven years to reach their marks, while yours only took three months to surpass them.

    The woman you just eclipsed, Miley, has been outspokenly critical of law enforcement through her platform. But as far as you’re aware, she’s never personally ended the life of an officer, or given the orders to execute an entire precinct. Pathetic, really.

    <blockquote>
    Nervous enough to begin listening to certain demands you’ve been making for weeks. In recent days, hostilities in the country have finally started cooling off. This is because of negotiations you just completed, which have resulted in a treaty between the Jubilite movement and the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> government.

    The treaty grants formal recognition of the island of Nantucket as a sovereign nation totally independent from the United States, which is now called New Whimsiphae. The mainland agrees to keep the power running, and all naval blockades lifted so you can continue supplying the island with needed resources.

    In exchange, you’ve agreed to a nonaggression pact with the <span class="caps">U.S.</span> and have publicly called for a nationwide cessation of hostilities from your Jubilite militias.

    No more capturing police stations, and no more expansion of Jubilite county territory. For now.

    <blockquote>
    But, to your surprise, Abby didn’t have to do much strong arming at all. Turns out you already had more in common than you’d thought. Apparently the boy band was curious about what all the commotion in America was really about, and Abby was more than happy to cut through the media play and walk them through it.

    She befriended Namjoon, and after many extensive dialectics about justice and the perils of capitalism, it seems the boys were inspired to start a revolution on their own terms. According to what you’re hearing on the news, they’ve already managed to take over their entire entertainment studio, completely ousting the previous ownership.

    And in their new position of political leverage, they’re galvanizing the people of their own nation to stand up for positive social change. They seem to have an inordinately principled aversion to “murder”, which leaves you a bit pessimistic about the ultimate efficacy of their methods, but you’ll let them play the game the way they want. For now.

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: So if the rich and powerful use their staggering wealth to entrench themselves in their positions of supremacy, then if we are also able to accumulate similar amounts of wealth… which we <span class="caps">HAVE</span>, thanks to <span class="caps">YOUR</span> brilliance… :)[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: This means it isn’t merely a “good idea” to use those levers to attack their power. It means we are <span class="caps">OBLIGATED</span> to use them![/color]
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: It is in fact the only way to defeat them. To abide more “honorable” practices would be to cede advantages to them which are counterproductive to us, and <span class="caps">WHOLLY</span> undeserved to them.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: And so, empowered thusly by our Supreme Honkifex, about a month ago I went to work with various channels of the most resourceful Jubilites I could find. Not to mention the ones with the least scruples about getting their hands dirty. :)[/color]

    <blockquote>
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: So let’s begin with an example of how one might use such levers. It’s well known among upper echelons of our organization that Secretary Abblepie herself targeted her own parents in a bold initial implementation of pranxis.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: But the success of that approach, while phenomenally instrumental in jumpstarting this movement, fell far short of total success. They’ve managed to secure most of their assets.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: So what other options exist? Well, one of the most direct tactics spelled out by the Supreme Honkifex is to apply assets toward legitimate acquisitions.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: A relatively small financial firm handles all their money. And once you have billions of dollars in the bank, the question becomes, can’t you just outright <span class="caps">BUY</span> certain companies, take control of them, and then begin to manipulate them to your advantage?[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: Why not? Billionaires and corporations everywhere do this all the time. Buy out competition, or purchase smaller inconvenient companies simply to strip or destroy them. Or absorb smaller companies into bigger ones, after retrofitting them to suit a new purpose.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: This can work! And we have had success with that approach in a few cases. The problem is that it’s a bit slow, and very much involves operating within the legal boundaries of a complex system in order to inflict damage on said system.[/color]
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: There are much faster ways! And that’s when things get more fun. :)[/color]

    <blockquote>
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: As our Supreme Honkifex rightly points out, why go to the expense and bother of <span class="caps">PURCHASING</span> a company, when you can simply <span class="caps">COMPROMISE</span> many of the people who are <span class="caps">ALREADY</span> <span class="caps">RUNNING</span> <span class="caps">IT</span>?? :) It’s so much faster that way, and it cuts through a lot of red tape![/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: Many of the people working in these financial firms are a bunch of spineless nerds who, while used to <span class="caps">HANDLING</span> the amount of money we’re talking about, are not used to actually being <span class="caps">PAID</span> that much.[/color]
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: This makes them highly susceptible to bribery, while their spinelessness makes them susceptible to acts of intimidation and coercion.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: And if you run into some guys who are afraid of the law? That’s where a good exit package can help. Just dangle a few million in front of a greedy coward, along with some plane tickets to somewhere in South America, some new identity papers, whatever it takes. And then you have someone who is suddenly very cooperative in helping you move a few billion in assets around.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: But sometimes even all <span class="caps">THAT</span> isn’t quite enough to get results. Sometimes you have a couple of really tough customers who’ve been fleeced already, and they’ve already locked everything down.[/color]
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: Such as the Secretary’s parents, for instance.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: With hard targets like that, there are certain tactics of last resort which can help move things along… if you catch my meaning. :)[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: But it gets better.[/color]
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: Soft assets I have defined as those not technically in our possession. These are assets still controlled by outsiders, who happen to be seriously <span class="caps">COMPROMISED</span> by us in some way.[/color]
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: This means that in the event it becomes necessary, there is a high likelihood the assets could be transferred over to us.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: Naturally it’s harder to get a concrete tally of these resources, but my estimates have our global soft assets at about $1.5 trillion.[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: thats a lot of fucking money[/color]
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: It sure is! :)[/color]
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: It turns out it’s a lot easier to move this kind of money around than you’d think, since there’s barely any real footprint to our movement.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: If we want to quietly transfer stock from a hedge fund into our portfolio, it’s just assigned to one of our members, rather than a formal Jubilite entity that’s easily traced.[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: We’re also counting occupied property as hard assets. That is, any empty house or building our forces have seized, and which authorities have deemed too difficult to reclaim. For instance, we have well armed Jubilites stationed in <span class="caps">THOUSANDS</span> of empty summer homes in Martha’s Vineyard alone! :)[/color]

    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: That is billions of dollars worth of property, not even to speak of the value of the entire island on which we stand. Such seizures have been taking place almost everywhere in the world.[/color]
    [color=#ce181e]<span class="caps">JOCULINE</span>: I must say it makes accounting estimates difficult! :) However I believe you will find my rough figures to be <span class="caps">QUITE</span> reliable.[/color]

    While Abby talks to her new friend who once named himself after a monster, you stare in the mirror at her old friend who may be in the process of turning herself into one. So much crazy stuff is happening constantly, it can be easy to start feeling numb to it. But maybe it’s a good idea to reflect on certain surreal truths now and then.

    Like how maybe it feels pretty messed up when your chill wine buddy has to sincerely offer cautionary remarks about turning into Joseph Stalin.

    That’s ridiculous, of course. Yes, many revolutionaries, after tasting success, would hear the siren’s song of mass murder. But you know in your heart you are different. You’ve never been more sure that you’re doing this for all the right reasons. And anyone who tried to convince you otherwise would probably regret it.

    again, this is [i]so close[/i] to a good lesson. people who think they can handle enormous power — even if they are already skeptical of people who have failed to handle enormous power before — are wrong.

    let’s just keep that in the back of our minds and see if that’s the ultimate takeaway at the end of the story.

    <blockquote>
    The report says Abby’s parents’ mansion has just exploded. Both are presumed dead, but there is no official confirmation of their deaths. But you don’t need confirmation. You know they’re dead. Your people did this. There is no other explanation, and they wouldn’t have done it if they weren’t sure the targets were inside at the time.

    You feel sick. This was Joculine. It had to be her. The bitch greenlit those orders behind your back before she died. When she floated the idea to you, it wasn’t a hypothetical. The orders were already out. <span class="caps">FUCK</span>!

    The feeling of heartbreak leaves a void. Rage fills it quickly, as usual. At first, it’s anger at yourself. You knew Joculine was a traitor. But you strung her along for an entire month, letting her play her games while you were biding your time, waiting for the right moment to put her down. If only you hadn’t been so lenient.

    You could have pulled the trigger weeks earlier, before she had the chance to get carried away. Or you could have just shot her the day you found out about her treachery.

But there are other factors to consider.

    Factors which all good sense and the hearts of our loved ones have rarely been able to compete with. There is the factor of inevitability.

    Inevitability is defined by the forces which try to stop it. Its strength is measured by everything that gets in its way only to be crushed. The power of a nation, the heart of a friend, and even the conscience of the host, or that is to say, the vessel meant to deliver the unstoppable.

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Keeping an unsorted list of people you’ve decided are bad is the kind of thing crazy dictators do[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: im not planning to do a mass purge and therefore it is okay to prepare all the resources and infrastructure to do one if i decide to later[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Hm. You are still my friend, but maybe I want to engage in your cult slightly less[/color]

    You think it’s a ridiculous idea that you might go on a hater killing spree. You know you’re better than everyone in history who’ve been like you up to this point, because you’re very self-confident.

    Suddenly, the person you murdered without justification’s murder is justified! It is very convenient for your present ethical dilemma. Anything you do will turn out to be justified and right, because you are so very confident, and that is what determines if a person’s actions are good or not. I, the story’s framing, am telling this to you, the reader.

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: I blame myself for my parents’ murder, because I was too complicit in your murder cult. we’re still cool tho[/color]

    You (zhen) think this murder is your fault, for not doing a different murder earlier. 

    You remember Abby’s warning about murder lists, though, from mere moments ago.

    [color=#0DA13E]<span class="caps">RIOTUS</span>: Hey. Anyone who opposes you in any way is an absolute threat, and need to be killed[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: well, i know abby is right, actually, but my new good friend riotus makes a good point about how i am perfect and everything i do is justified, so i will do those murders instead of not doing them, as was our previous plan[/color]

    </blockquote>
    Zhen is, of course, a textbook narcissist, so it’s not surprising that Abby’s concerns don’t have any effect on her. Abby is there to fuel her, not to be a friend.

    Joculine here is murdered for revenge, not because she did anything harmful to the organization. Zhen doesn’t even think she’s a saboteur! She’s not considered a suppressive person, she’s murdered because the leader has a personal grievance with her, and then the murder is justified after the fact.

    No, really, look at that. Zhen hates Joculine because she was mean to her online in the past. Maybe she was just a troll, or she called Zhen out on some legitimately bad behaviour. That’s left deliberately unclear. And now she’s hinted that she wants a promotion. That’s what got her killed. Not killing Abby’s parents, not anything else. And that murder is portrayed as a heroic, narratively satisfying act!

    Joculine is summarily judged and executed for the crime of being an anti. And I use Anti here in the same way as the story: a poorly-defined truncation that ultimately only serves to label people as with you or against you. This scene, where Zhen murders Joculine for being mean to her online, really is one of her lowest points. It’s the basest, most absurd way one could react to “cancel culture”. 

    So why does the framing of the story love it?

    This scene gets an animation. The camera adores Zhen during the full sequence of gunplay. The moment is satisifying, and the afterglow is proud. 

    So does the story mean to explicitly glorify this? Yes. I don’t know any other way you could read this but yes.

    The brand hasn’t been doing too badly these days.

    In fact, it would be hard to imagine how it could be doing any better, considering your account now has more followers than any other account in the world, short of instagram itself. But even then, with @instagram sitting at 358 million, you aren’t too far behind passing that milestone either.

    And you don’t see much standing in your way of that feat, seeing as you recently made short work of other names you once thought untouchable.

    It was 35 days ago you dealt with Joculine, and ordered the great Summer Purge of 2020 later that night. While your covert ops people all over the world were quietly mowing down the haters and the antis, your brand was busy zipping past the top accounts. In the final week of July, it was Kim Kardashian, then Selena Gomez and Kylie Jenner.

    Three queens who you’re quite sure would never bother to bat an eye at a pest like you. How quickly they’ve been reduced to relative obscurity and poverty compared to you. You doubt you’d even answer a text message from any one of them at this point.

    Days later, you’d topple actor and professional wrestler Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, followed shortly by a musician and actress named Ariana Grande. Impressive milestones to pass for sure, but by then you weren’t even paying attention to them. Your eyes were squarely locked on the number one spot, held by legendary footballer, Cristiano Ronaldo.

    You had never heard of him, since you know nothing of soccer, but he’s a good looking guy and you made sure to blow him a kiss as you passed him. None of this is personal. Unless they make it personal, in which case, you have ways of dealing with that.

    <blockquote>
    But you’re still somewhat taken aback by the continued success of your account, considering you don’t post nearly as much content as you used to. It was once the most critical priority, pushing that content out every day. It was the sole driver of the numbers, whereas now the movement is, along with the geopolitical complexity resulting from your every move. Just as well.

    Producing a broad range of engaging social media content is a chore you really don’t need, since you’ve got a rogue state to run. Rather than carefully planning shoots and crafting the perfect aesthetic as you once did, you’ve mostly been getting by posing near all your sick and very expensive contraband. Fortunately, your subscribers seem more than appeased by these offerings.

    <blockquote>
    The media is most abuzz with the events of last week, which saw the fall of the Russian government. Jubilites ransacked the Kremlin, and now have full control over the military. This was surprising to you. A Russian coup somehow wasn’t on your radar at all. But you guess it wasn’t too out of character for the nation.

    It was about 100 years ago these people did roughly the same thing after all. Maybe the instinct for leftist revolution passed on by their ancestors was activated by your radical clown messaging. Maybe it was in their blood all along, and that’s why their shitty regime was the first to fall.

    But many other countries don’t seem far behind, and appear to be on the brink of collapse too, as the rowdy Jubilite factions continue to swell.

    If America is to share the same fate, it won’t happen like it just did in Russia.

    America’s brand of imperialism and capitalism was built to take a beating, designed to bring the whole world down with it if it’s ever truly threatened.

    So however you play this, you’ll need to tread very carefully.

    You’ll need to prepare a good strategy, especially since if anything goes wrong, the backlash will be felt first and most fiercely by your tiny summer colony. In short, you’ll need to prepare for war.

    <blockquote>
    You have fully militarized the former island of Nantucket. With your advanced pranxis methods still in full effect even without Joculine’s oversight, the state of New Whimsiphae has amassed nearly a trillion dollars in hard assets, and several trillion more in soft assets.

    The tabulation of these resources has never been an exact science, but then, economists probably run into similar difficulties assessing the true extent of an entire nation’s economic value. And that roughly describes the nature of your global movement now. It’s a nation rivaling the <span class="caps">GNI</span> of many industrialized countries, with its population and assets spread out across every country in the world.>

    And that’s pretty cool, you think. But that doesn’t mean you’re getting complacent. You have no intention of letting these assets go to waste. Counted among your hard assets are many tangible acquisitions, including caches of weapons, vehicles, fuel, all the supplies of war, and many other staples of societal self-sufficiency, stashed in every nation you could name.

    All conceivable contraband necessary for a burgeoning global paramilitary organization, and then some.

    It’s nothing you’ll ever see covered in the media, but the moment Russia was seized by Jubilites, virtually the entire global economic order went into motion behind the scenes, beginning to rearrange itself to hedge all the bets.

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: bitch dont laugh![/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: this is serious! its a serious plan!![/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Its fucking <span class="caps">RIDICULOUS</span>!!![/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: We can barely run one island as it is! Thousands of people here are sick![/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Were surrounded by the fucking navy! They could shut off the power and supply chains any time really, or just outright <span class="caps">STORM</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">ISLAND</span> if they finally get fed up![/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: You want <span class="caps">ANOTHER</span> island to deal with??[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yeah why not[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: What about the fucking <span class="caps">TREATY</span>?[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: You signed a nonaggression pact and it was a miracle the government even allowed that in the first place![/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: believe me i havent forgotten about that piece of shit treaty[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: and it wasnt a miracle, it was just a lie[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: something the government used to buy them some time while they figured out the best way to wipe us out while defusing the ticking time bomb all the mainland jubilites represent[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: they have no intention of honoring the treaty in the long run. when has america ever bothered with that?[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: so im just doing what i always do[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: the best defense… no the <span class="caps">ONLY</span> defense is to always stay on offense[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: im preparing in advance for the moment they rip the treaty up[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: it will encourage jubilites everywhere to stake more claim over the rest of the country if we can secure more territory for the homeland[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Homeland?? Z, you moved here <span class="caps">THREE</span> <span class="caps">YEARS</span> <span class="caps">AGO</span>[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: you know what i mean[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: It wasnt even the homeland of the people we just kicked out[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Nantucket is a native word! If we start talking about things that way, arent we just doing like. The things we said were bad?[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: I dont know… i think im losing the plot here![/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: its perfectly simple[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yes, american imperialism is evil, so we are taking a stand against it[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: and the only way to do that is capture and repurpose territory in order to weaken america[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: and this must be done even if we are not the original inhabitants of the land, because we have no choice[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: otherwise wed have to sit back and say, go ahead, keep being evil america, because were all too much of a bunch of pussies to claim anything for ourselves[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: get it??[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Yes, i do, but[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Are you <span class="caps">REALLY</span> telling me you dont see any humor or absurdity to the fact that youre in my livingroom with a bunch of fucking maps plotting an invasion, or excuse me, an <span class="caps">ANNEXATION</span> of marthas fucking vineyard?[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: A few months ago you were struggling to wake up before 3 pm and cringe posting on tiktok![/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i mean, not yet?? ive been fucking busy here[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: what would i even tell them to do?[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Thats a pretty good question! Seems like a question someone who was just bragging about assuming “full control” over russia should be able to answer![/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i dont think you really get how this works! im the supreme honkifex of a <span class="caps">GLOBAL</span> <span class="caps">MOVEMENT</span>! i need to be able to <span class="caps">DELEGATE</span>! like, let the russian guys figure shit out over there because i dont really know how anything <span class="caps">WORKS</span> there![/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Im not trying to mess with you here, im just trying to follow whatever your logic is[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: You “control” russia and its nukes… but you wont use the nukes because obviously thats insane[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: So what does controlling that country even mean? How are you using that to your advantage when you defend us from american aggression?[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: well first of all now if the <span class="caps">US</span> wants to attack us its almost like attacking russia right? theyd have to consider global retaliation possibilities[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: like any basic geopolitical alliance[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Sure, but[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: If you keep escalating with the us government, have you really thought about what that alliance means?[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Theres a reason russia and all its nukes never fucked with america. Because if they tried it would be a huge mess… like world war three??[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Then the nukes might start going off, and if that happens, everybody loses[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: So it seems like all youre really doing here is creating situations that are increasingly elaborate stalemates??[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yeah i think you have just fucking described the basic objective of international politics throughout all of world history[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i still dont know what your point is![/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: You also seem to be taking it as a given that the coups in russia and wherever else are resulting in stable situations…[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Are you even sure about that?[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Now that you have a bunch of loyal clowns occupying the kremlin or whatever, do you have any idea what sort of government theyre going to establish?[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: uhhhh[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yeah? a better one[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Is there a president? Do they have a parliament or something? Is there a constitution??[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yeah the jubilite manifesto[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Your manifesto doesnt even say anything about running a country![/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Its mostly a bunch of absurd clown lore that came from your dreams, a lot of esoteric gender theory, half of which we both <span class="caps">PULLED</span> <span class="caps">OUT</span> <span class="caps">OF</span> <span class="caps">OUR</span> <span class="caps">ASS</span> one day, and a detailed manual on how to prank rich people out of their money![/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Theres nothing at all about governance or how to actually apply our socialist ideas in the form of a coherent state that emerges from the vacuum after all these revolutions you’re causing![/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Did you even think about <span class="caps">ANY</span> of this??[/color]

    This chapter has such a fun and interesting political dialogue I really didn’t want to interrupt it. Abby’s concerned that Zhen’s plan of “just do stuff” isn’t a great one, specifically because it literally isn’t solving the problems it was meant to solve. Like, textually, we’re told that; aside from popularity, it’s failing. 

    Then Zhen proposes another plan that consumes resources without directly impacting anything they mean to impact. See, all Zhen is interested in is the destructive side of revolution. Again, textually:

    <blockquote>
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: its perfectly simple[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yes, american imperialism is evil, so we are taking a stand against it[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: and the only way to do that is capture and repurpose territory in order to weaken america[/color]

    </blockquote>
    All Zhen’s steps are destructive. Kill a cop, kill more cops, take an island, take another island. Gain popularity, social influence, and money along the way, of course, but the real goal here is to lash out against capitalism. 

    Abby, of course, points out that jubilite successes are actually [i]benefiting[/i] capitalism, and that Zhen doesn’t actually have any sort of plan to do any real damage to her target aside from lashing out at whatever edges she can reach. 

    Zhen’s retort to this is confidence. She’s got clout, she’s got tanks. She feels in control. What she doesn’t have is any plan that could possibly result in the “fall of America” or even any plans for how to run a country. No economic or political system in place, just hot revolutionary fervor. “[color=#b35fe9]Z: once weve achieved total victory, there will be <span class="caps">PLENTY</span> of time to sort out how to run governments and shit[/color]“. Zhen is conquest and [i]only[/i] conquest.

    Another case here with the music: “Flare: Insurrection Remix” was originally “Flare (Green Sun Remix)”, an unreleased test track shared around during Clark Powell’s tenure on the music team. It’s a great track, and I’m glad it’s seeing the light of day!

    Oh man, we’re quickly coming up on the end of the story with no dramatic twist in sight. What will be the fate of our sociopathic little noodle?

    I was going to reference “my body fell” or “partners in crime” or maybe even fruity pebbles somewhere in there but I don’t think the story’s earned that yet. We’ll see.

    <blockquote>
    Between your three flights, you spent almost 24 hours in the air. You swapped planes at each stop to cover your tracks. Abby set it all up in advance.

    She chartered the planes, made the payments, and you were off. Your nerves were high on initial takeoff, for fear you might get shot down. But military planes never even came near you.

    A simple passenger jet, taking off in darkness, heading southeast. Maybe it wasn’t worth their time. Or maybe an invasion was never even imminent at all.

    You took off west from Bermuda just before daybreak. You swept across a burning nation, and rode the edge of dawn all the way to Hawaii.

    The sun outpaced your plane across the sky by a bit, making for one long sunrise following you on your journey. A lovely view, but you slept through most of it. You were very tired.

    You landed in Fiji some time in the afternoon. You didn’t know which airport, or even which of the roughly 300 islands that comprise the nation.

    All you know is, it’s a beautiful day, and as far as you can tell, hardly anyone here could give a shit about the clown revolution that’s consuming the rest of the world.

    To bypass <span class="caps">COVID</span>-19 travel restrictions, Abby arranged a series of ludicrously expensive bribes in advance, while you were both still in flight.

    Then once off the tarmac, to clear customs she produced two fake passports out of thin air. One for each of you.

    You wonder how long she’s been preparing for a getaway like this. How long she’s been scared enough to think about such things. You feel so bad.

    You acquired a car, and now drive around the island a bit, with no destination in particular.

    Wherever you go, you’re half expecting to see signs that the global unrest has seeped into society here as well. But there’s none of that. Just people living their lives.

    Strange how the crazy thing you started was simultaneously a global movement that’s currently ripping the world apart at the seams, yet also a bubble.

    As if it was just something you always had the power to log off from, and the moment you do, it starts feeling like all along it was a hot mess of nothing much whatsoever.

    As if the litigation of the entirety of human civilization was little more than a tempest in a teapot you set to boil a few minutes too long.

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: the entire <span class="caps">US</span> has splintered into a patchwork of regions under jubilite control[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: almost the entire pacific northwest is seceded territory. im not even sure if the government is trying to challenge that secession yet, since there are no reports of forces entering that region[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: like, the <span class="caps">US</span> military is huge? but the reality of all out civil war is also huge, and i think its impossible to realistically contain the whole thing at once, no matter how big the military is[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: so it looks like theyre focusing efforts on keeping the rest of the map from disintegrating. putting out all the smaller fires everywhere else[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: But on the drive to the airport we saw fires everywhere[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yeah i think that was all from localized skirmishes, not from an outward assault by the military[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: my guess is theyre still hanging back and waiting to see if the <span class="caps">CIA</span> coup would just get us all to tear each other apart on the island and do the work for them, so they dont even have to invade or bomb[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: but also…[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i suspect the main reason the government is reluctant to outright bomb the island is theyre all worried about it being seen as like[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: something that would incite more radicalism and rebellion than theyre already dealing with[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: if she printed out a badge to fuck with me, then suddenly the only piece of hard evidence i had to suspect a <span class="caps">CIA</span> coup in the first place was <span class="caps">FAKE</span>![/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: they were probably just a bunch of guys she managed to rope into the mutiny[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i bet they didnt even realize she was framing them as agents[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: did i just inadvertently help an alien colonize earth with a lot of batshit clown philosophies[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: am i the useful idiot in another insidious imperialist campaign[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: but i was too stupid to realize i was his pawn because i was caught up in the idea that it was all coming from <span class="caps">ME</span>?[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: There are a lot of ways you could decide to worry about all this[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: But this one seems pretty out there tbh[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i dunno[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: i dont really think they were “just dreams”[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: but they may not have been literal messages from an alien either[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: maybe i cant explain what i mean[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: he could have been a product of my deranged imagination…[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: but there are times when i catch myself dozing and jump out of my sleep with a sudden terrifying thought[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: that he might be the one who is dreaming of me[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Thats a much crazier and more paranoid thought than if you just wanted to believe he was a real alien[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: To save your sanity, maybe you should just believe hes real, and not worry about it?[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: What would even be the harm of that[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: So a clown talked to you in your sleep, and convinced you to help him take over the world by proxy[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: With like, clown lore instead of ships and guns[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Kinda cool actually! And it also sorta lets you off the hook[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: If you were under the influence of some sinister alien force, then no matter how this keeps playing out, it wasnt due to bad intentions on your part[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: regardless of my intentions, i mean…[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: imperialism is still bad right?[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: no matter what form it takes. thats one of the things i kept hammering in my manifesto[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: practically all the evils on earth right now seem to stem from it, the further back you trace everything[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: hell, isnt what were doing now just more colonialism??[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: What. Sitting here on this island?[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yeah. i mean moving here[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: just another couple of westerners invading this island paradise in the pacific because i just thought it sounded cool[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: like, this is basically how that happens isnt it? little by little until indigineous populations are displaced, and native cultures are conquered[/color]

    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: But thats not even why were here[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Its not a vacation and we certainly didnt do it because we thought it was cool[/color]
    [color=#6aa6ef]<span class="caps">ABBY</span>: Were basically fucking fugitives now[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: nobody can ever relocate to somewhere else in the world without passively participating in something vaguely evil[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: but most of those people could hardly stand to stay put where they were either[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: so what are they even supposed to do[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: the whole history of the globe is just a long chronicle of hysterical people running away from shit[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: away from the persecution of assholes, or the problems of their own making[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: its hard to even blame all those europeans for running across the ocean to get away from the plagues and famines and shitty kings ruining their own countries[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: but the more they piled onto the new continent the more they turned it into a huge graveyard for the people they were visiting[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: and if that wasnt enough, then they set up shop[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: put up bright neon lights telling the world this is the place where all the good shit happens[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: if the vibes of your homeland are rancid, come here. we gentrified the place already, buried all the squatters we found when we got here[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: now you can do whatever you want. go nuts![/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: and that marketing effort worked[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: it kept bringing more and more people in. people on the run from their pain and traumas[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: and once they arrive they just perpetuate the misery that came before, while simultaneously becoming fresh victims of it[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: thats whats so weird about it… you run away to a new country to find a better life and just become complicit in the evil of its original settlement[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: yet you also become a victim of its false promises. you got lured by its bait, and then it runs you into the fucking ground with all the other bodies that were sacrificed to serve this lie[/color]

    [color=#b35fe9]Z: my parents were just another couple of sacrifices[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: enticed to america when they were young and running away from shit[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: they took the bait, and the nation utterly destroyed them[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: if any country in the history of the world deserved to get fucked up this badly[/color]
    [color=#b35fe9]Z: it was ours[/color]

    Oh, was that supposed to be a thing? I’ve just been calling her Zhen the whole time, because of all the attention the intro gave to the correct way to pronounce it. And I guess I’m used to my instincts from real life, where shortening someone’s name because it’s hard for you to pronounce is a super rude thing to do.

    Throughout this story I’ve occasionally poked fun at the characters or poked fun at the writing. Those should be distinct and separate things, of course. In any piece of fiction, the writer and the written characters aren’t the same, and can’t be treated as synonymous. Just because someone writers a character — even the protagonist — doing something doesn’t mean they agree with that decision. This is a basic distinction, and should generally go without saying.

    There are some cases, though, where that distinction can sorta break down. For psycholonials specifically, after going through the story, I’m forced to think that the author wants you to agree with Zhen. That there is an active thesis being made by the writing, and that thesis is that Zhen was right. I feel like that’s self-evident at this point, but I’m going to make the case for it anyway. 

    There’s a ton of evidence for this. Joculine’s whole deal, those spoons… this very ending conversation, for one. Zhen, shouting directly into the camera, “we were right about everything!!!!!!” as part of her happy ending. The story being told (not just by Zhen, but by the narrative itself) is that the movement was right, the violence was right, taking action — and taking action in the way that they did — was right. The problem wasn’t us, because we had hearts of gold and all that juicy self-confidence. No, the problem was… everybody else! The haters! The outside agitators who came in and… defended the world against you, I guess!

    <span class="dquo">“</span>All the left wing shit” isn’t wrong on its merits, it’s just that implementing it always ends in disaster firing squad murder, because this kind of social movement seems to naturally cause people to act that way. So it’s not your fault when it happens! The problem was that [i]ego[/i] somehow got wrapped up in a movement that required someone motivated by ego in order to exist and succeed in the first place. Maybe the problem, really, was that other people choose to [i]follow[/i] my ego cult.

    That’s what Zhen thinks at the end, and that’s what the story is trying to say. There’s no subversion here, no bitterly ironic ending. We’re actually just supposed to agree with Zhen and see her as a hero prima facie.

    Even the [i]camera[/i] tells that story. Look at the shots in Chapter 8:

    [img]https://file.garden/YOVpTKX47HhECOuA/psycholonials/posts/lp-psycholonials-chapter-9-side-a/psycholonials8/2021-07-09 23_03_54-Psycholonials.png[/img]
    [img]https://file.garden/YOVpTKX47HhECOuA/psycholonials/posts/lp-psycholonials-chapter-9-side-a/psycholonials8/2021-07-09 23_04_50-Psycholonials.png[/img]
    [img]https://file.garden/YOVpTKX47HhECOuA/psycholonials/posts/lp-psycholonials-chapter-9-side-a/psycholonials8/2021-07-09 23_06_54-Psycholonials.png[/img]

    This isn’t supposed to be a deranged rant, this is meant to be righteous anger given as the hero’s last stand. The camera is on her side throughout. 

    If I were wrong about that — if this whole story was all an elaborate in subverting the idea that Zhen is a hero — I would expect to see a few things that I just don’t. Fundamentally, I’d expect to see anything Zhen does portrayed by the storyteller as potentially a bad thing. There’s none of this. There aren’t any consequences, obviously, but there’s also a conspicuous lack of narrative or artistic choices to even hint to the reader that something might be wrong. If you want to question Zhen at any point in the story, that work is left entirely up to you to do for yourself.

    There’s just a lot of post-hoc justification in this story. I talked about Joculine already, and she’s probably the strongest example of it. 

    There’s also a lot of cases where the tone becomes negative after something awful happens, but never [i]because[/i] of the awful thing. The tone shift feels almost obligatory. It turns out it was good to kill Joculine, not because she had people killed, but because she was mean to us online once. It was bad to issue a sweeping kill order not because murder is wrong, but because it made our friend Abby uncomfortable. Et cetera. 

    And, I mean, that’s just looking at the narrative on its own without any real-world evidence. That’s because if you add in [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200603045914/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1267815083704385537]even[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200531160957/https://twitter.com/HSPesterquest/status/1267122903226580993]a[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200602201151/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1267584158039228424]little[/url] [url=https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1311635037989801988]bit[/url] ([url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200602201151/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1267584158039228424]shoot[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200603045914/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1267815083704385537]there’s[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200531160957if_/https://twitter.com/HSPesterquest/status/1267122903226580993]too[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200531162244if_/https://twitter.com/HSPesterquest/status/1267123302616592384]many[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200502075847/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1252260403536703488]for[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200119151328/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1218770740599590912]the[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200602232446/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1267814524075356160]gag[/url]) of context about the ideas Andrew Hussie promoted <span class="caps">IRL</span>, that seals the deal pretty overwhelmingly.

    The first and only instance of interactivity in the game! Very exciting.

    You cannot use the right arrow key at this choice. 

    If you click the menu here everything sometimes just breaks. You have to crash out of the program and replay the chapter again. You cannot load a save. This does not seem intentional.

    Either choice you make, the icon you select falls on Zhen’s head and deals some Psychic Damage:

    The sword animation seems to be a little faster, so there’s a hot speedrunning tip for you

    So all this business about the sword and the crown is an allusion to the [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damocles#Sword_of_Damocles]Sword of Damocles[/url], the idea of the abrupt dichotomy between the luxuries of the crown and the dangers and enemies that come with power. There are different ways to interpret that story, but as far as the “danger” part goes, the honkifex successors get that in spades.

    (Also, all the clown assassinations are drawn over scenes of famous historical assassinations, in case you missed that.)

    Oh, and hey, let’s talk about clown assassination, because boy is [i]that[/i] a statement about this same social dynamic. This is a direct continuation of the argument from “I <span class="caps">GET</span> <span class="caps">IT</span> <span class="caps">NOW</span>!”; that the hierarchical social structure in place in a révolutionnaire community naturally leads to vicious infighting. That this infighting is directly analogue to clout chasing on social media, and that social structures that revolve around cults of personality fall to infighting. That there isn’t a “good clown”, as Zhen says. 

    If this ending has one message it’s trying to leave us with, it seems like it’s that. Although, really, it takes a significant amount of effort to sift out a cohesive statement from this story, because it really does seem [i]very[/i] confused. Of course, there are some general freebie themes (“capitalism bad”, “colonialism bad”), but every time the author tries to compose some original salient lesson about internet society it just comes out weak, confused, or simply wrong.

    <blockquote>
    hey its me again

    dont worry, not that crazy fucking godhead version of myself you just saw me incinerate with brain fire, or whatever it was i did there. its the Real Me this time. zhen

    i can understand what youre going for here. or maybe you arent. maybe you just stumbled on this save file by accident? all i can say is what id be trying here if i were you.

    see, i used to be a pretty bigtime gamer.

    and for the sake of completionism, id want to set up a save file right before my final dream,

    so i could proceed to spam the hell out of all the possible sword/crown combos to see if i could get a different ending

    i also used to do a lot of coding. and there were, what. 5 binary sword/crown choices in a row? so if i were in your shoes, id know right away thats 32 possible permutations to try out.

    which sounds like a huge pain in the ass, but if youre a true gamer like i was, you gotta do it, right?

    </blockquote>
    actually I wrote a decompiler to figure out what the script actually says, since there’s no way there are 32 unique rout— y’know what, sorry, continue

    <blockquote>
    the thing is, given how much you were just trying to mess with me, im not even sure if you deserve this courtesy. but since i ran away ive been trying to do things differently.

    not hang on to stupid grudges so much, you know?

    </blockquote>
    i mean, it wasn’t the reader who made those choices happen, but go ahead

    <blockquote>
    so in the spirit of rising above our petty grievances, i figured id do you a solid by deleting all your save files, and leaving a note here letting you know not to bother with all that

    no matter what pattern of choices you make, they all lead to the same ending. thats cause it was always my choice to make, not yours.

    and i was always gonna choose the sword regardless of what hoops you tried to make me jump through.

    for all thats been made of “free will”, and the significance of my choices versus yours, the funny thing is, i dont think it was ever much of a choice for me at all.

    i honestly think the path i chose was the only one i was even capable of. i love her too much to even think about leaving her again

    maybe i owe you a proper letter, as long as im going to the trouble of rolling up this note, shoving it in a bottle and lobbing it in the ocean. hard to say where it ended up.

    i guess thats wherever you happen to be right now? but then, im sure all shores look the same to a bottle thats been adrift for a long time.

    and in a sense, all shores pretty much are the same, arent they? theyre just the places where the ocean finally decides to leave the dirt alone, and benevolently allows us a little space to walk about.

    its always made me happy to think about the ocean. puts me in a good mood

    so in keeping with these good vibes, why dont we stretch out a little here. give my final thoughts more breathing room.

    hang on, im gonna do the thing where we hop over to the left side of the screen so i can put more words down at once…

    (sorry)

    <blockquote>
    maybe youre wondering how long its been since that final dream i had. theres no reason to get too precise about it. lets just say its been years. long enough for me to settle down a little more, reflect on what that was all about, and finally get around to writing you this letter. if i did this any sooner, maybe there are a few things id still be too proud to admit. so im glad i waited

    to proud to admit what? ok, heres one. for a few years after i got here, i felt pretty guilty about destroying america. it felt crazy for me to think that way after all my big talk. and the guilt certainly had nothing to do with changing my mind in regards to the issues i had with my old country.

    its just that making a big mess and leaving a bunch of people to kill each other has a way of haunting you for a while

    i checked up on the news pretty often at first, and sometimes i even cried when i read about it. but slowly, i stopped checking as much, and felt less guilty little by little. eventually i lost interest in checking on it at all. i havent read a story about the place formerly known as america in years, except to glance at a stray headline here and there.

    it has the exact same feeling i used to have as an american when i would catch a headline about some other foreign country where crazy shit was going on. like, not my business, too complicated… involving names im unfamiliar with and political parameters that escaped my ability to keep up with long ago

    the only thing that really changed is i erased all the imaginary fucking lines that got drawn all over the continent by a bunch of completely deranged people a couple hundred years ago. good riddance to fake shit

    so i get a funny feeling when i look at maps now. theyre worthless now because nobody can update them fast enough in this global political climate. lol, watching google maps go through its various contortions over the years has been hilarious actually. ive kinda adapted by imposing like… “line blindness” on myself.

    i look at the continental <span class="caps">US</span> and i just ignore whatever lines the cartographers are peddling these days, and i focus on the shape of the water hugging the land. same as it ever was, and its sort of comforting in that sense

    theres that funny looking hook shape that makes up cape cod. below you have the decapitated dragon. thats how i used to see it when i was a kid. marthas vineyard is a dragon head. you can see if it you imagine the southwestern tip is the snout. then its stumpy little body is nantucket.

    even when i was on the island acting like a warlord, glancing at a map would always make me laugh for this reason. theres the dead dragon again, lol. there was this crazy character who used to mutilate her stuffed dragons. looking at those islands always reminded me of her. i dunno, im just shitposting here at this point. but what im trying to say is…

    i just really love islands. ive always been naturally drawn to them. fantasizing about them, making absurd getaway plans focusing on certain islands, and then i literally did run away to an island… twice. and now i think i understand why i was so obsessed with them. its because they cant be as easily defined by the invisible bullshit lines people like to draw on maps.

    their shapes are always naturally carved out by the ocean that surrounds them, and people can never tell the ocean what to do. the only influence people can have on the ocean is through climate change, and all that does is make the damn thing <span class="caps">BIGGER</span>. makes it stronger, almost like, wakes it up? its slumber is what allowed us to walk on these bits of dry dirt in the first place.

    once it slowly stirs from its slumber, it begins to remind us who was in charge all along. who has the ultimate ability to drown this planet of the self important infestation known as humanity. we probably still have a little ways to go before that happens, so we might as well spend it reflecting on the very suicidal tendencies we indulge in to keep the doomsday clock ticking away, inch by watery inch

    which makes me think of… god i almost hate to even bring her up. almost feels like a sour note here? but this was supposed to be about the truth, and the truth is, i still think about her all the time.

    when you kill somebody while looking them right in the eyes, even if they deserved it, they stick with you forever. that last look on joculines dumb clowny face is seared into my brain for life

    its not like how i felt about destroying america for a while. ive never felt guilty about her. she was pretty awful and she had to go. but since i was her executioner, she became part of me for good. just like in our old fandom days, whatever garbage we read or played got soaked up by our souls and became a permanent part of our identities

    she and i went way back, to when we were just kids mingling in the same fandoms. except i never paid much attention to her, or cared about her at all. she was just some rando to me? theres a lot of people like that in fandom. its not like you can be fuckin besties with everybody.

    she kept trying to get in my face, but honestly i barely even remember this because she was just some nobody trying to make something happen with me when i just plain wasnt interested. i was like 14! i had other shit going on, school, depression, i dunno. i cant remember a single interaction we had back then cause all her pesky shit was just that unimportant

    but she probably didnt like the fact that i kept brushing her off. so later, while i was going through some huge life problems, she spun up some bullshit about how the bad things i said online were the height of immoral behavior. as if she could give the slightest fucking shit about “virtue” lol.

    its just an easy way to run someone into the ground once you decide you dont like them, and she knew that. everybody does i think

    but then lo and behold, she shows up later dressed as a clown, kissing my ass. as if nothing ever happened. drives me crazy thinking about this. not because of what a snake she was, its more than that. its the obsession, but even weirder, it was the fucking carelessness about how she played it??

    she didnt even delete her old account before going under cover. then shes all strutting around in front of me, taking off her coat, showing off her tattoo. i think on some level she wanted me to know! wanted to be like, im back bitch. time for round two, or three or whatever, in this one sided game we were playing that only she cared about

    actually its the only thing about this that makes me feel kinda sad about her. all that posturing and conniving… i think the only explanation is she just liked me the whole time, and wanted me to notice her. or maybe more like… hate-liked me? bear in mind the fandoms we used to roll in were pretty wack, and gave us all some weird ideas about human interaction and romance

    and the most fucked up thing about this is, i kinda get it? i see where she was coming from practically every step of the way. she was just empty inside, and earlier she was trying to use some sick made up “rivalry” with me to fill the void.

    then later when i started a clown revolution she jumped all over that, because if she could use it to make herself feel important, then maybe that would fill the void instead. is she unique in this way? hell no. were all the same. were all empty inside, grasping for ways to make ourselves whole, and i was too

    remember at the beginning when i was drunk and depressed in my apartment, wondering what i was “about”? its the same shit she was probably going through. she coped with these demented phony persecution campaigns, i coped with, uh… well you saw how that all went.

    literally everybody is doing this!!! and you can never tell them thats what theyre doing, theyll deny it with their dying breath, and i would have too if you tried to come at me while i was in full psycho mode

    everybodys got their cover story to deflect any honest attempt to penetrate the layers of bullshit. “um actually, its about advocating for a higher standard of <span class="caps">VIRTUE</span> in the <span class="caps">MEDIA</span> we consume!!” alright, whatever you say pal. “um actually, its about <span class="caps">ETHICS</span> in <span class="caps">GAME</span> <span class="caps">JOURNALISM</span>!!”

    suuuuure man, that totally makes a ton of sense! “um actually, its about holding certain individuals <span class="caps">ACCOUNTABLE</span> for their previously <span class="caps">PROBLEMATIC</span> <span class="caps">BEHAVIOR</span>!!” oh for sure. nothing sus about that at all. “um actually, its all about the <span class="caps">PRIDE</span> i have for my <span class="caps">NATION</span>!!” right, never heard that one before.

    its definitely not an idea thats repeatedly led to insanely bad problems or anything, so keep having fun with that

    the sad thing is, the harder you bang the table and insist your cover stories are the <span class="caps">REAL</span> <span class="caps">REASON</span> why youre tripping on some preposterous shit, the flimsier they appear to everybody watching. after a while people catch on that youre mostly trying to convince yourself with the cover story, and not others so much.

    youve just got so much invested in believing you bought into all this shit for the reasons youre saying you are, and not for the sake of filling the void inside you. because if you were forced to admit that, the void would open right back up, and there it is again. all that pain and existential misery. cant let that happen, right??

    so sometimes we even aid and abet each other in keeping our mutual bullshit cycles spinning, like a sick kind of treaty. you dont call my bullshit if i dont call yours. because then where would we be?

    are you nodding along with all this very wisely? well i should hope the fuck so, because its all true as shit. but maybe youre then wondering, ok sounds cool and all zhen, but whats the actual answer? how do you put a stop to this, how do you kill your own cover stories and fill the void with something better?

    im not that good at coming up with solutions, its more like… my skill is identifying problems and then destroying them utterly. like what i did to america. but was that a <span class="caps">SOLUTION</span>? idk, probably not.

    so i can say a few things that might fuck you up forever, but dont hold your breath waiting for me to give you the one neat trick that finally unfucks your humpty dumpty ass back together again

    heres the cheap answer i could give you. its love. love will pull you out of that pit of despair and fill the hole in your soul for good. its really tempting to believe that, especially since… i guess thats pretty much what happened to me?? haha.

    thats just me though, and it would be stupid to take the lessons from the insane shit i just went through and try to broadly apply them to somebody i know nothing about. its also just… wrong? i could sit here from the comfort of this fijian paradise and tell you, if only you get out there and find that perfect waifu, youll finally be healed.

    but then id just be setting you up to chase something else, and you probably wont find it right away, or maybe never at all. then you might feel bitter and angry about that, take it out on whichever poor fool you were chasing, and sink right back behind another fuckin cover story thats even worse than the one you started with. so this cant be about chasing somebody.

    in fact, investing yourself in chasing <span class="caps">ANYTHING</span> kinda sucks, and just amounts to the same blind alley whether its a person or an ideology or some other vague shit

    so thats a no on love? well, not quite. its a no and a yes. but i had to drop the no part first because that was important. but to get to the yes part, you need to understand where im coming from. is way too simple to say abby swooped in and her love and support healed me completely. thats not what i mean.

    think of it this way. imagine you filled the void in your soul with whatever brand of horseshit someone hooked you on, or you hooked yourself on. and youre in the abyss. youre miserable and you dont even realize. attacking people, obsessed with pointless crap, regurgitating the same talking points forever, sinking deeper into this fucked up place every day.

    its not good for you but you just cant see it. now imagine theres someone nearby, maybe you just met or maybe theyve always been there. theyre just smiling at you but you became blind to their smile. you took it for granted because it was always just there

    they can see what youre putting yourself through but you cant. now imagine they jump into the abyss with you to try and pull you out. they do it at enormous cost to themselves, and you return the favor by fighting them at every turn. but they just keep trying, and theres no reward for them at all except getting to see you become a happier person. if that isnt what love is then i dont think love exists

    so back to this sorta generic question i asked, is love the answer? the no part is obvious, but the yes part is kind of subtle. you cant go chasing love to cure yourself, and yet, i still think its an essential ingredient for getting better. maybe the trick is to realize its not in as short supply as you think. people who want to see you do better and be happy are everywhere.

    if you keep shutting them all out by parroting your cover stories over and over, youll swear they dont exist too, just like i used to

    does that mean abby totally healed me? thats complicated too. some things are just a part of me that will never disappear. joculines shocked face. stuff that happened with my parents. the aerial view of an entire nation on fire because of one little speech i gave. so ill never be “healed”, thats just the wrong word. mainly it just feels so good that somebody cares about me this much.

    i feel so good all the time, every day. im never in a bad mood anymore, its kinda crazy. sometimes i wonder if someone like me even deserves to feel this good, but i dont even care if i dont. when im happy shes happy, and thats what makes it worth it trying to stay this way

    for the first few years we lived here, every night i could swear i saw a sword in the sky. you know like, a little constellation of stars shaped like a sword, pointing right down at me. it bugged me, always made me think of the choice i made. but after a while, id look up at the same part of the sky, and i couldnt see it anymore. id strain to see it, but it just wasnt there.

    its not like the stars disappeared or anything, or rearranged themselves… it was more like my mind couldnt bring itself to do whatever it was doing to trick me into seeing it. then, kinda like the illusion of america itself, i started forgetting i could ever see it at all

    so when my godhead dream self was ranting all menacingly about “choosing the sword”, like ooooh, watch out! watch out for being happy because it might <span class="caps">COME</span> <span class="caps">BACK</span> <span class="caps">TO</span> <span class="caps">HAUNT</span> <span class="caps">YOU</span>!! lol what a load of shit. whats going to happen to me? im going to die? of course im going to die. ill die of old age, or some other shit before that, which is the reality everybody lives with.

    it doesnt matter. i made the right choice, and im not scared of anything as long as im with her. we have a good life here, and will enjoy it for however long we get to have it. our horse percy grew up to be so strong and beautiful and we love him dearly. for a while we started wondering about adopting a kid but they still dont let you do that here.

    thats fine though because we decided a big beautiful horse is more than enough family for everybody

    im gonna get going now. its been fun, in sort of a lopsided way. you could see me but i couldnt see you. you got to obsess over me, got to fuck with my head by trying to insist your decisions for my life are better than mine somehow.

    im not mad at all though, and honestly, i appreciate all the simping youve done. im very impressed. but its my final wish for you that the moment i disappear from your life, youll begin to realize that once im gone, the only person left to impress will be yourself. peace

    So, believe it or not, a lot of what Zhen says here about cancel culture is actually right, taken literally. It’s absolutely possible to pick out a goal (“hurt a person I dislike”, for instance) and then use a phony excuse to go about doing it. Want to hate women in the games industry? Hate women in the games industry, but insist it’s about ethics in journalism somehow. Really mad that trans people exist? Make a forum where you make threads about specific public trans people so you can catalogue every individual stupid thing they do, but insist their identities aren’t the reason. Want to harass someone you don’t like over some personal squabble from when you were fourteen? Put together a callout post and publish a bunch of weird old blackmail material. Sometimes it’s vindictive, sometimes it’s out of a misguided sense of puritanianism, sometimes it really is just to get attention. It’s totally possible to use social media to pursue your own goal while using some insincere pretext you can insist is your real motivation. 

    The problem, of course, is that doesn’t make the reverse true. Not [i]all[/i] concerns about ethics are fake, not [i]all[/i] concerns about people in a community are attempts at character assassination. This is obvious, of course. The reason those cover stories work at all is because ethics or pedophilia or toxic behaviour or whatever is because those things [i]are[/i] actually real concerns. 

    Now, why do I even bring that up? It’s not like people are going around saying all concerns raised about them on the internet are automatically harassment, or transphobia, or stalking, right? That would be absurd. But it happens. You see people throw on another “layer of bullshit”, as Zhen calls it, and say that all criticism of them is automatically in such bad-faith that their critics should be reviled, without any consideration of the issue itself. 

    You’ll see snakes call things “hit pieces” that aren’t, or people hunting down critics of anyone in their demographic just to publicly insult them. You see people say any criticism of them is an attack on whatever minority group they decide to identify with, and that their critics need to be silenced by any needs necessary. They’ll even advocate actual murder (which Zhen actually does in this story, and is praised for)! It’s all just another trumped-up pretext, but this time, instead of just hurting someone you shouldn’t, it’s a pretext that can defend even the indefensible. And, of course, there are always people who will take full advantage of being able to do the indefensible without consequence. And that’s before we even [i]touch[/i] on how all this gets used for lateral violence in and between vulnerable communities. But I’m commenting here, not writing an essay.

    I think one of the problems really [i]is[/i] social media, actually. There’s something about social media — the rapid-fire of information, the gamification of human interaction, the platforms aiming to drive up engagement for corporate profit — that discourages people from taking the time to “penetrate the layers of bullshit” and actually [i]think[/i] about the things being said. It’s far, far easier to just agree with whatever rhetoric the people you like already are using than to take the time and make the effort to actually look at the substance of any given issue for yourself. “Anyone opposed to X party is bad” and “anyone who even [i]tolerates[/i] anyone I say is bad is also bad” are patently absurd evaluation metrics, but they’re sadly much easier metrics to use than thoughtfully engaging in each issue you care about. That takes real time and energy, so your social media content/effort output ratio is going to be much better if you take the shortcuts.

    Oh, and love wins. Did we mention?
