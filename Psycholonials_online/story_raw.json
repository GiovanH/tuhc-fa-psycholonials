In general, I think the music and art are good, but the story itself has\u2026 some issues. Interesting ones though, at\u00a0least!\n\nThe captions and comments throughout the rest of this are a mixture of notes from my original blind playthrough and postcommentary to add details or references where\u00a0relevant. \n\nI know, I know, there are dozens of Psycholonials playthroughs on YouTube already, but I still wanted to wait until the anniversary to give everyone who wanted to buy the game a chance to. But those aren\u2019t accessible text, nor is the game, so this still seemed like a worthwhile exercise.

I\u2019ve heard\u2026 shocking little about it, since it came out. Apparently it\u2019s about clout, and the main character is bad? That\u2019s most of what I know going in. Oh, and Clark Powell apparently composed the soundtrack! I\u2019m a fan of theirs, so that should be\u00a0fun.\n\nA while ago, I went through the first chapter of the game, but I mostly got distracted by technical details.

Why mess with\u00a0it?\n\nThis particular hodgepodge of pop cultural nonsense says as much about yourself as you\u2019d ever care to say using a\u00a0wall.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s a consequence of the media you consume that made you feel this way, but you\u2019ve always believed you can tell a lot about a person by studying the things they used to like. In fact, you might even go as far as saying in this era, an individual\u2019s personality isn\u2019t much more than a composite of all the media they\u2019ve ever consumed, and their favorite stuff in\u00a0particular.\n\nThat\u2019s why whenever you meet someone new, you kind of wish you could just look at their bedroom and take a quick tour of all their interests, sparing you a lot of laborious banter and wondering over whether someone\u2019s worth your\u00a0time.\n\nAgain, it could be certain types of content you\u2019ve consumed in your past which resulted in this philosophy, but you can\u2019t be sure. All you can do is refresh your memory on your various interests to reaffirm who you are to yourself, along with any imaginary voyeurs who have inexplicably decided to tune into your underwhelming morning\u00a0ritual.\n\n</blockquote>\nThe format of this game is essentially this. A visual novel, but with drawn panels instead of sprites, and with powerpoint transitions between them. You can use the back arrow in the navigation to go back to the previous panel, but there\u2019s no history\u00a0view.\n\nI have no idea what resolution the game is supposed to be run at. There\u2019s no indication, or any graphical options. Internally the panels are a ludicrous 2048 pixels wide, although that seem to be after being incorrectly imported to unity \u2014 more on that at the\u00a0end.",

Probably yours too. Oh, it\u2019s not? That\u2019s because it isn\u2019t real. The Silence Mill is a shell company that was cobbled together by Andrew Hussie on 7/2/20, just a few months before he released the first Psycholonials trailer. It\u2019s incorporated in Delaware, for tax avoidance purposes. This is a favourite trick of Andrew\u2019s, so much so that when I saw Andrew associated with a new company I just checked Delaware\u2019s incorporation records and there it all was. It was actually set up by the incredibly fake sounding \u201c[url=https://twitter.com/giovan_h/status/1356804005612167169]The Company Corporation[/url]\u201c, which is a real company that helps people set up tax havens in Delaware. The Silence Mill does have [url=https://www.thesilencemill.com]a website[/url], which \u2014 unlike psycholonials.com \u2014 never got updated at any point, and still just has a youtube embed of the game trailer and nothing else, not even a store link. Anyway, the long and short of it is \u201cThe Silence Mill Inc.\u201d is just Andrew self-publishing through yet another shell company he just set\u00a0up. \n\nAnyway, as for the menu, there\u2019s also a chapter select here, but it has thumbnails which are spoilers. I have those thumbnails at the ends of chapters\u00a0instead.",

Just over half a million new\u00a0subscribers.\n\nThis total was unfathomable to you at one point, but you have to keep reminding yourself this is a modest fraction of Abby\u2019s total fandom. They count as your fans too now, only by the promotion she has generously provided. The true test comes soon when you begin to flex your vision in front of a sizable starting\u00a0crowd.\n\nYou\u2019ve begun releasing the introductory portions of your manifesto, which have been met with a largely positive reception, if somewhat confused as\u00a0well.\n\n</blockquote>",

Like, he has [i]capital[/i] capital. \nThat\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s always made his whole juggaloo thing a little odd. Like, that\u2019s a community that\u2019s deeply rooted in working-class-to-poverty culture. You don\u2019t typically see wealthy white men coming in. I mean, I\u2019m no expert (juggalologist), but it strikes this casual observer as odd. \nSo when I heard someone coming from that position wrote a political story that touched heavily on themes of modern wealth and class conflict. I was interested in seeing how he was going to portray that dynamic. \nAnd here it is, I\u00a0guess.\n\n<hr>\n\nYou can play and pause these video dealies with the on-screen controls.

It could also overwhelm him, when you really need his wits as sharp as possible, so he can play the role of a wealthy suitor to a middle-aged billionaire\u00a0woman.\n\nAfter all the flirtatious pleasantries are over, you and Abby retire to the living room as you continue walking him through the\u00a0play.\n\n</blockquote>",

Part of her political praxis? Personally, in real life, I see having enormous amounts of money and wasting it on personal expression while others are suffering from poverty as a bad thing. The kind of thing that makes billionaires bad. Because billionares are bad for reasons that directly relate to the things they choose to be and do, and not just because of the label. That whole\u00a0thing.\n\nI honestly love how the art in Psycholonials plays with resolution. The mixed pixel resolution ([url=https://indiehellzone.com/2021/11/29/psycholonials-part-3-sword-and-crown/#:~:text=chump%20on%20the-,mixels%20,-(%3C-%20really%20funny%20phrase)]mixels?[/url] are actually a very expressive tool. You\u2019ll commonly see things like that last panel, where the body is low-resolution and upscaled without any filtering, and then the face is drawn on at another scale. It\u2019s actually really charming, and it allows for things like that Percy panel, where the face is comically simplified, to work naturally within the\u00a0artstyle.",

The media has become obsessed. It\u2019s fascinating to many for its unusual and incendiary ideological focus, and just as captivating to others for resembling a slow-motion train\u00a0wreck.\n\nThere is a sense among your millions of new followers that the more sensational, criminal elements surrounding the daily drama of your brand will only get worse, and people are here for\u00a0it.\n\n</blockquote>",

It\u2019s defined in a manifesto the player has not been\u00a0shown. \n\nThe ideology itself seems to be \u201csociety is bad, do whatever crimes you want, I was mad anyway.\u201d It\u2019s almost South Park-esque in how much it romanticises applied apathy and the pursuit of\u2026 what? Money, followers? A bunch of instrumental goods that just sit in a hoard and aren\u2019t being used for [i]anything[/i], good [i]or[/i] bad. And with how willing she is to rope other people in and casually destroy their lives, it\u2019s obvious there\u2019s no room here for any actual respect towards others. Zhen says she has these long-term goals, but if she did she wouldn\u2019t be taking these absurd, suicidal\u00a0risks. \n\nI don\u2019t know if this was the intended read, or if the authors really [url=https://homestuck2.com/bonus/a-treatise-on-representational-democracy/13]thought they had come up with something deep and meaningful even though it\u2019s obviously terrible if you think about it for even a\u00a0minute.[/url]\n\nI wonder if there are zhen did nothing wrong stans out there, somehow. Probably not, because this game did not sell\u00a0well.\n\nIs this just becoming reverse fight club now?

I mean, it\u2019s really not hard to write a good anti-cop story, don\u2019t get me wrong. It\u2019s just that this one very clearly isn\u2019t.

      "b": "So there are a lot of specific historical events from 2020 being referenced here. Obviously Covid, but also the mass protests against police brutality following the murder of George Floyd, and specifically the occupation of Seattle dubbed the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (<span class=\"caps\">CHAZ</span>) in June. The idea, basically, was to cut off police presence in the area entirely, and show that the community could support itself and thrive without a militant police\u00a0presence.\n\nWrapped up in the real-life protesting was this concept of \u201coutside agitators\u201d. This is rhetoric used to discredit political unrest by saying the actors came from \u201coutside\u201d \u2014 either from outside the affected community, or physically foreign agents \u2014 and the visible unrest doesn\u2019t represent any legitimate grievances of the\u00a0people. \n\nNotably, in real life, there was actual police brutality, and the \u201coutside agitators\u201d narrative was a false one. There were actual atrocities being protested, instead of just people who got angry on the internet. Psycholonials has yet to directly touch on the former, other than just saying it\u2019s the case; ascribing adjectives to it through the lens of Zhen\u2019s\u00a0narration.\n\nAlso, unlike what happened the actual capital hill autonomous zone, there is zero mutual aid or any sort of community support on Clown Island. In the absense of anything to suggest otherwise, it seems like it\u2019s every clown for themself, with nothing resembling production, sustainability, or support. Again, just no community. It is, again, the kind of militaristic anarchy fantasy you would expect to see a villain of a story\u00a0execute.\n\nMaybe Psycholonials is a lesson in the importance of not organizing your social movement around unstable people whose primary motivations is their personal frustrations and fame. That could be a good lesson: \u201chey, don\u2019t base your important social movement around Instagram influencers.\u201d I could get behind\u00a0that.",

By the time the sun was setting and boats were returning from their round trips, only a handful of people still waited on the piers. And when boats came back from their dropoffs, many of the waiting locals were a little puzzled to find that the boats weren\u2019t returning\u00a0empty.\n\nThey were always filled with new groups of well-armed people, jumping onto the docks with gusto and scattering into the neighborhoods and disappearing. Not running away from the danger, but right into\u00a0it.\n\nWith every boatful of locals dropped off at the Massachusetts shore, your people always had another squad of recruits from the mainland ready to jump onboard and head to the\u00a0island.\n\nIt continued on like this for hours, back and forth across the sound. Where the population at the beginning of the day was around 10,000, the final headcount after a near-total evacuation was 13,000. Your false flag maneuver simply replaced the entire population of the island with rabid Jubilites, and then\u00a0some.\n\n</blockquote>",

And they would keep coming well after the evacuation, too. There was no need to bother with the pretense of renting airbnbs anymore, or keeping a low\u00a0profile.\n\nThe new residents of the island began occupying the houses vacated by locals, along with the large supply of empty summer homes. No form of authority existed to stop you anymore. Collectively, all of you <span class=\"caps\">ARE</span> the\u00a0authority.\n\nThe only thing left to do is wait and see how this authority will be challenged by the government once it comes to grips with how badly it just got bamboozled.

You are still my friend, but maybe I want to engage in your cult slightly less[/color]\n\nYou think it\u2019s a ridiculous idea that you might go on a hater killing spree. You know you\u2019re better than everyone in history who\u2019ve been like you up to this point, because you\u2019re very\u00a0self-confident.\n\nSuddenly, the person you murdered without justification\u2019s murder is justified! It is very convenient for your present ethical dilemma. Anything you do will turn out to be justified and right, because you are so very confident, and that is what determines if a person\u2019s actions are good or not. I, the story\u2019s framing, am telling this to you, the\u00a0reader.\n\n[color=#6aa6ef]<span class=\"caps\">ABBY</span>: I blame myself for my parents\u2019 murder, because I was too complicit in your murder cult. we\u2019re still cool tho[/color]\n\nYou (zhen) think this murder is your fault, for not doing a different murder\u00a0earlier. \n\nYou remember Abby\u2019s warning about murder lists, though, from mere moments\u00a0ago.\n\n[color=#0DA13E]<span class=\"caps\">RIOTUS</span>: Hey. Anyone who opposes you in any way is an absolute threat, and need to be killed[/color]\n\n[color=#b35fe9]Z: well, i know abby is right, actually, but my new good friend riotus makes a good point about how i am perfect and everything i do is justified, so i will do those murders instead of not doing them, as was our previous plan[/color]\n\n</blockquote>\nZhen is, of course, a textbook narcissist, so it\u2019s not surprising that Abby\u2019s concerns don\u2019t have any effect on her. Abby is there to fuel her, not to be a\u00a0friend.\n\nJoculine here is murdered for revenge, not because she did anything harmful to the organization. Zhen doesn\u2019t even think she\u2019s a saboteur! Then the murder is justified after the\u00a0fact.\n\nNo, really, look at that. Zhen hates Joculine because she was mean to her online in the past. Maybe she was just a troll, or she called Zhen out on some legitimately bad behaviour. That\u2019s left deliberately unclear. And now she\u2019s hinted that she wants a promotion. That\u2019s what got her killed. Not killing Abby\u2019s parents, not anything else. And that murder is portrayed as a heroic, narratively satisfying\u00a0act!\n\nJoculine is summarily judged and executed for the crime of being an anti. And I use Anti here in the same way as the story: a poorly-defined truncation that ultimately only serves to label people as with you or against you. This scene, where Zhen murders Joculine for being mean to her online, really is one of her lowest points. It\u2019s the basest, most absurd way one could react to \u201ccancel\u00a0culture\u201d. \n\nSo why does the framing of the story love\u00a0it?\n\nThis scene gets an animation. The camera adores Zhen during the full sequence of gunplay. The moment is satisifying, and the afterglow is\u00a0proud. \n\nSo does the story mean to explicitly glorify this? Yes. I don\u2019t know any other way you could read this but\u00a0yes.",

      "b": "This chapter has such a fun and interesting political dialogue I really didn\u2019t want to interrupt it. Abby\u2019s concerned that Zhen\u2019s plan of \u201cjust do stuff\u201d isn\u2019t a great one, specifically because it literally isn\u2019t solving the problems it was meant to solve. Like, textually, we\u2019re told that; aside from popularity, it\u2019s\u00a0failing. \n\nThen Zhen proposes another plan that consumes resources without directly impacting anything they mean to impact. See, all Zhen is interested in is the destructive side of revolution. Again,\u00a0textually:\n\n<blockquote>\n[color=#b35fe9]Z: its perfectly simple[/color]\n[color=#b35fe9]Z: yes, american imperialism is evil, so we are taking a stand against it[/color]\n[color=#b35fe9]Z: and the only way to do that is capture and repurpose territory in order to weaken america[/color]\n\n</blockquote>\nAll Zhen\u2019s steps are destructive. Kill a cop, kill more cops, take an island, take another island. Gain popularity, social influence, and money along the way, of course, but the real goal here is to lash out against\u00a0capitalism. \n\nAbby, of course, points out that jubilite successes are actually [i]benefiting[/i] capitalism, and that Zhen doesn\u2019t actually have any sort of plan to do any real damage to her target aside from lashing out at whatever edges she can\u00a0reach. \n\nZhen\u2019s retort to this is confidence. She\u2019s got clout, she\u2019s got tanks. She feels in control. What she doesn\u2019t have is any plan that could possibly result in the \u201cfall of America\u201d or even any plans for how to run a country. No economic or political system in place, just hot revolutionary fervor. \u201c[color=#b35fe9]Z: once weve achieved total victory, there will be <span class=\"caps\">PLENTY</span> of time to sort out how to run governments and shit[/color]\u201c. Zhen is conquest and [i]only[/i]\u00a0conquest.",

      "b": "Throughout this story I\u2019ve occasionally poked fun at the characters or poked fun at the writing. Those should be distinct and separate things, of course. In any piece of fiction, the writer and the written characters aren\u2019t the same, and can\u2019t be treated as synonymous. Just because someone writers a character \u2014 even the protagonist \u2014 doing something doesn\u2019t mean they agree with that decision. This is a basic distinction, and should generally go without\u00a0saying.\n\nThere are some cases, though, where that distinction can sorta break down. For psycholonials specifically, after going through the story, I\u2019m forced to think that the author wants you to agree with Zhen. That there is an active thesis being made by the writing, and that thesis is that Zhen was right. I feel like that\u2019s self-evident at this point, but I\u2019m going to make the case for it\u00a0anyway. \n\nThere\u2019s a ton of evidence for this. Joculine\u2019s whole deal, those spoons\u2026 this very ending conversation, for one. Zhen, shouting directly at the camera, \u201cwe were right about everything!!!!!!\u201d as part of her happy ending. The story being told is that the movement was right, the violence was right, taking action \u2014 and taking action in the way that they did \u2014 was right. The problem wasn\u2019t us, because we had hearts of gold and all that juicy self-confidence. No, the problem was\u2026 everybody else! The haters! The outside agitators who came in and\u2026 defended the world against you, I\u00a0guess!\n\n<span class=\"dquo\">\u201c</span>All the left wing shit\u201d isn\u2019t wrong on its merits, it\u2019s just that implementing it always ends in disaster firing squad murder, because this kind of social movement seems to naturally cause people to act that way. So it\u2019s not your fault when it happens! The problem was that [i]ego[/i] somehow got wrapped up in a movement that required someone motivated by ego in order to exist and succeed in the first place. Maybe the problem, really, was that other people choose to [i]follow[/i] my ego\u00a0cult.\n\nThat\u2019s what Zhen thinks at the end, and that\u2019s what the story is trying to say. There\u2019s no subversion here, no bitterly ironic ending. We\u2019re actually just supposed to agree with Zhen and see her as a hero prima\u00a0facie.\n\nEven the [i]camera[/i] tells that story. Look at the shots in Chapter\u00a08:\n\n[img]https://file.garden/YOVpTKX47HhECOuA/psycholonials/posts/lp-psycholonials-chapter-9-side-a/psycholonials8/2021-07-09 23_03_54-Psycholonials.png[/img]\n[img]https://file.garden/YOVpTKX47HhECOuA/psycholonials/posts/lp-psycholonials-chapter-9-side-a/psycholonials8/2021-07-09 23_04_50-Psycholonials.png[/img]\n[img]https://file.garden/YOVpTKX47HhECOuA/psycholonials/posts/lp-psycholonials-chapter-9-side-a/psycholonials8/2021-07-09 23_06_54-Psycholonials.png[/img]\n\nThis isn\u2019t supposed to be a deranged rant, this is meant to be righteous anger given as the hero\u2019s last stand. The camera is on her side\u00a0throughout. \n\nIf I were wrong about that \u2014 if this whole story was all an elaborate in subverting the idea that Zhen is a hero \u2014 I would expect to see a few things that I just don\u2019t. Fundamentally, I\u2019d expect to see anything Zhen does portrayed by the storyteller as potentially a bad thing. There\u2019s none of this. There aren\u2019t any consequences, obviously, but there\u2019s also a conspicuous lack of narrative or artistic choices to even hint to the reader that something might be wrong. If you want to question Zhen at any point in the story, that work is left entirely up to you to do for\u00a0yourself.\n\nThere\u2019s just a lot of post-hoc justification in this story. I talked about Joculine already, and she\u2019s probably the strongest example of\u00a0it. \n\nThere\u2019s also a lot of cases where the tone becomes negative after something awful happens, but never [i]because[/i] of the awful thing. The tone shift feels almost obligatory. It turns out it was good to kill Joculine, not because she had people killed, but because she was mean to us online once. It was bad to issue a sweeping kill order not because murder is wrong, but because it made our friend Abby uncomfortable. Et\u00a0cetera. \n\nAnd, I mean, that\u2019s just looking at the narrative on its own without any real-world evidence. That\u2019s because if you add in [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200603045914/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1267815083704385537]even[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200531160957/https://twitter.com/HSPesterquest/status/1267122903226580993]a[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200602201151/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1267584158039228424]little[/url] [url=https://web.archive.org/web/2/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1311635037989801988]bit[/url] ([url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200602201151/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1267584158039228424]shoot[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200603045914/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1267815083704385537]there\u2019s[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200531160957if_/https://twitter.com/HSPesterquest/status/1267122903226580993]too[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200531162244if_/https://twitter.com/HSPesterquest/status/1267123302616592384]many[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200502075847/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1252260403536703488]for[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200119151328/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1218770740599590912]the[/url] [url=http://web.archive.org/web/20200602232446/https://twitter.com/homestuck/status/1267814524075356160]gag[/url]) of context about the ideas Andrew Hussie promoted <span class=\"caps\">IRL</span>, that seals the deal pretty overwhelmingly.

There are different ways to interpret that story, but as far as the \u201cdanger\u201d part goes, the honkifex successors get that in\u00a0spades.\n\n(Also, all the clown assassinations are drawn over scenes of famous historical assassinations, in case you missed\u00a0that.)\n\nOh, and hey, let\u2019s talk about clown assassination, because boy is [i]that[/i] a statement about this same social dynamic. This is a direct continuation of the argument from \u201cI <span class=\"caps\">GET</span> <span class=\"caps\">IT</span> <span class=\"caps\">NOW</span>!\u201d; that the hierarchical social structure in place in a r\u00e9volutionnaire community naturally leads to vicious infighting. That this infighting is directly analogue to clout chasing on social media, and that social structures that revolve around cults of personality fall to infighting. That there isn\u2019t a \u201cgood clown\u201d, as Zhen\u00a0says. \n\nIf this ending has one message it\u2019s trying to leave us with, it seems like it\u2019s that. Although, really, it takes a significant amount of effort to sift out a cohesive statement from this story, because it really does seem [i]very[/i] confused. Of course, there are some general freebie themes (\u201ccapitalism bad\u201d, \u201ccolonialism bad\u201d), but every time the author tries to compose some original salient lesson about internet society it just comes out weak, confused, or simply\u00a0wrong.",

ok, heres one. for a few years after i got here, i felt pretty guilty about destroying america. it felt crazy for me to think that way after all my big talk. and the guilt certainly had nothing to do with changing my mind in regards to the issues i had with my old\u00a0country.\n\nits just that making a big mess and leaving a bunch of people to kill each other has a way of haunting you for a\u00a0while\n\ni checked up on the news pretty often at first, and sometimes i even cried when i read about it. but slowly, i stopped checking as much, and felt less guilty little by little. eventually i lost interest in checking on it at all. i havent read a story about the place formerly known as america in years, except to glance at a stray headline here and\u00a0there.\n\nit has the exact same feeling i used to have as an american when i would catch a headline about some other foreign country where crazy shit was going on. like, not my business, too complicated\u2026 involving names im unfamiliar with and political parameters that escaped my ability to keep up with long\u00a0ago\n\nthe only thing that really changed is i erased all the imaginary fucking lines that got drawn all over the continent by a bunch of completely deranged people a couple hundred years ago. good riddance to fake\u00a0shit\n\nso i get a funny feeling when i look at maps now. theyre worthless now because nobody can update them fast enough in this global political climate. lol, watching google maps go through its various contortions over the years has been hilarious actually. ive kinda adapted by imposing like\u2026 \u201cline blindness\u201d on\u00a0myself.\n\ni look at the continental <span class=\"caps\">US</span> and i just ignore whatever lines the cartographers are peddling these days, and i focus on the shape of the water hugging the land. same as it ever was, and its sort of comforting in that\u00a0sense\n\ntheres that funny looking hook shape that makes up cape cod. below you have the decapitated dragon. thats how i used to see it when i was a kid. marthas vineyard is a dragon head. you can see if it you imagine the southwestern tip is the snout. then its stumpy little body is\u00a0nantucket.\n\neven when i was on the island acting like a warlord, glancing at a map would always make me laugh for this reason. theres the dead dragon again, lol. there was this crazy character who used to mutilate her stuffed dragons. looking at those islands always reminded me of her. i dunno, im just shitposting here at this point. but what im trying to say\u00a0is\u2026\n\ni just really love islands. ive always been naturally drawn to them. fantasizing about them, making absurd getaway plans focusing on certain islands, and then i literally did run away to an island\u2026 twice. and now i think i understand why i was so obsessed with them. its because they cant be as easily defined by the invisible bullshit lines people like to draw on\u00a0maps.\n\ntheir shapes are always naturally carved out by the ocean that surrounds them, and people can never tell the ocean what to do. the only influence people can have on the ocean is through climate change, and all that does is make the damn thing <span class=\"caps\">BIGGER</span>. makes it stronger, almost like, wakes it up? its slumber is what allowed us to walk on these bits of dry dirt in the first\u00a0place.\n\nonce it slowly stirs from its slumber, it begins to remind us who was in charge all along. who has the ultimate ability to drown this planet of the self important infestation known as humanity. we probably still have a little ways to go before that happens, so we might as well spend it reflecting on the very suicidal tendencies we indulge in to keep the doomsday clock ticking away, inch by watery\u00a0inch\n\n</blockquote>\nwhile I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s just presented here as zhen being edgy and speaking the harsh truth, this is actually a real ideology called [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism#Neo-Malthusian_theory]malthusian ecofascism[/url], and goes hand-in-hand with a number of [url=https://www.newstatesman.com/science-tech/social-media/2018/09/eco-fascism-ideology-marrying-environmentalism-and-white-supremacy]other unsavory\u00a0philosophies[/url]\n\n<blockquote>\nwhich makes me think of\u2026 god i almost hate to even bring her up. almost feels like a sour note here? but this was supposed to be about the truth, and the truth is, i still think about her all the\u00a0time.\n\nwhen you kill somebody while looking them right in the eyes, even if they deserved it, they stick with you forever. that last look on joculines dumb clowny face is seared into my brain for\u00a0life\n\nits not like how i felt about destroying america for a while. ive never felt guilty about her. she was pretty awful and she had to go. but since i was her executioner, she became part of me for good. just like in our old fandom days, whatever garbage we read or played got soaked up by our souls and became a permanent part of our\u00a0identities\n\nshe and i went way back, to when we were just kids mingling in the same fandoms. except i never paid much attention to her, or cared about her at all. she was just some rando to me? theres a lot of people like that in fandom. its not like you can be fuckin besties with\u00a0everybody.\n\nshe kept trying to get in my face, but honestly i barely even remember this because she was just some nobody trying to make something happen with me when i just plain wasnt interested. i was like 14! i had other shit going on, school, depression, i dunno. i cant remember a single interaction we had back then cause all her pesky shit was just that\u00a0unimportant\n\nbut she probably didnt like the fact that i kept brushing her off. so later, while i was going through some huge life problems, she spun up some bullshit about how the bad things i said online were the height of immoral behavior. as if she could give the slightest fucking shit about \u201cvirtue\u201d\u00a0lol.\n\nits just an easy way to run someone into the ground once you decide you dont like them, and she knew that. everybody does i\u00a0think\n\nbut then lo and behold, she shows up later dressed as a clown, kissing my ass. as if nothing ever happened. drives me crazy thinking about this. not because of what a snake she was, its more than that. its the obsession, but even weirder, it was the fucking carelessness about how she played\u00a0it??\n\nshe didnt even delete her old account before going under cover. then shes all strutting around in front of me, taking off her coat, showing off her tattoo. i think on some level she wanted me to know! wanted to be like, im back bitch. time for round two, or three or whatever, in this one sided game we were playing that only she cared\u00a0about\n\nactually its the only thing about this that makes me feel kinda sad about her. all that posturing and conniving\u2026 i think the only explanation is she just liked me the whole time, and wanted me to notice her. or maybe more like\u2026 hate-liked me? bear in mind the fandoms we used to roll in were pretty wack, and gave us all some weird ideas about human interaction and\u00a0romance\n\nand the most fucked up thing about this is, i kinda get it? i see where she was coming from practically every step of the way. she was just empty inside, and earlier she was trying to use some sick made up \u201crivalry\u201d with me to fill the\u00a0void.\n\nthen later when i started a clown revolution she jumped all over that, because if she could use it to make herself feel important, then maybe that would fill the void instead. is she unique in this way? hell no. were all the same. were all empty inside, grasping for ways to make ourselves whole, and i was\u00a0too\n\nremember at the beginning when i was drunk and depressed in my apartment, wondering what i was \u201cabout\u201d? its the same shit she was probably going through. she coped with these demented phony persecution campaigns, i coped with, uh\u2026 well you saw how that all\u00a0went.\n\nliterally everybody is doing this!!! and you can never tell them thats what theyre doing, theyll deny it with their dying breath, and i would have too if you tried to come at me while i was in full psycho\u00a0mode\n\neverybodys got their cover story to deflect any honest attempt to penetrate the layers of bullshit. \u201cum actually, its about advocating for a higher standard of <span class=\"caps\">VIRTUE</span> in the <span class=\"caps\">MEDIA</span> we consume!!\u201d alright, whatever you say pal. \u201cum actually, its about <span class=\"caps\">ETHICS</span> in <span class=\"caps\">GAME</span> <span class=\"caps\">JOURNALISM</span>!!\u201d\n\nsuuuuure man, that totally makes a ton of sense! \u201cum actually, its about holding certain individuals <span class=\"caps\">ACCOUNTABLE</span> for their previously <span class=\"caps\">PROBLEMATIC</span> <span class=\"caps\">BEHAVIOR</span>!!\u201d oh for sure. nothing sus about that at all. \u201cum actually, its all about the <span class=\"caps\">PRIDE</span> i have for my <span class=\"caps\">NATION</span>!!\u201d right, never heard that one\u00a0before.\n\nits definitely not an idea thats repeatedly led to insanely bad problems or anything, so keep having fun with\u00a0that\n\nthe sad thing is, the harder you bang the table and insist your cover stories are the <span class=\"caps\">REAL</span> <span class=\"caps\">REASON</span> why youre tripping on some preposterous shit, the flimsier they appear to everybody watching. after a while people catch on that youre mostly trying to convince yourself with the cover story, and not others so\u00a0much.\n\nyouve just got so much invested in believing you bought into all this shit for the reasons youre saying you are, and not for the sake of filling the void inside you. because if you were forced to admit that, the void would open right back up, and there it is again. all that pain and existential misery. cant let that happen,\u00a0right??\n\nso sometimes we even aid and abet each other in keeping our mutual bullshit cycles spinning, like a sick kind of treaty. you dont call my bullshit if i dont call yours. because then where would we\u00a0be?\n\nare you nodding along with all this very wisely? well i should hope the fuck so, because its all true as shit. but maybe youre then wondering, ok sounds cool and all zhen, but whats the actual answer? how do you put a stop to this, how do you kill your own cover stories and fill the void with something\u00a0better?\n\nim not that good at coming up with solutions, its more like\u2026 my skill is identifying problems and then destroying them utterly. like what i did to america. but was that a <span class=\"caps\">SOLUTION</span>? idk, probably\u00a0not.\n\nso i can say a few things that might fuck you up forever, but dont hold your breath waiting for me to give you the one neat trick that finally unfucks your humpty dumpty ass back together\u00a0again\n\nheres the cheap answer i could give you. its love. love will pull you out of that pit of despair and fill the hole in your soul for good. its really tempting to believe that, especially since\u2026 i guess thats pretty much what happened to me??\u00a0haha.\n\nthats just me though, and it would be stupid to take the lessons from the insane shit i just went through and try to broadly apply them to somebody i know nothing about. its also just\u2026 wrong? i could sit here from the comfort of this fijian paradise and tell you, if only you get out there and find that perfect waifu, youll finally be\u00a0healed.\n\nbut then id just be setting you up to chase something else, and you probably wont find it right away, or maybe never at all. then you might feel bitter and angry about that, take it out on whichever poor fool you were chasing, and sink right back behind another fuckin cover story thats even worse than the one you started with. so this cant be about chasing\u00a0somebody.\n\nin fact, investing yourself in chasing <span class=\"caps\">ANYTHING</span> kinda sucks, and just amounts to the same blind alley whether its a person or an ideology or some other vague\u00a0shit\n\nso thats a no on love? well, not quite. its a no and a yes. but i had to drop the no part first because that was important. but to get to the yes part, you need to understand where im coming from. is way too simple to say abby swooped in and her love and support healed me completely. thats not what i\u00a0mean.\n\nthink of it this way. imagine you filled the void in your soul with whatever brand of horseshit someone hooked you on, or you hooked yourself on. and youre in the abyss. youre miserable and you dont even realize. attacking people, obsessed with pointless crap, regurgitating the same talking points forever, sinking deeper into this fucked up place every\u00a0day.\n\nits not good for you but you just cant see it. now imagine theres someone nearby, maybe you just met or maybe theyve always been there. theyre just smiling at you but you became blind to their smile. you took it for granted because it was always just\u00a0there\n\nthey can see what youre putting yourself through but you cant. now imagine they jump into the abyss with you to try and pull you out. they do it at enormous cost to themselves, and you return the favor by fighting them at every turn. but they just keep trying, and theres no reward for them at all except getting to see you become a happier person. if that isnt what love is then i dont think love\u00a0exists\n\nso back to this sorta generic question i asked, is love the answer? the no part is obvious, but the yes part is kind of subtle. you cant go chasing love to cure yourself, and yet, i still think its an essential ingredient for getting better. maybe the trick is to realize its not in as short supply as you think. people who want to see you do better and be happy are\u00a0everywhere.\n\nif you keep shutting them all out by parroting your cover stories over and over, youll swear they dont exist too, just like i used\u00a0to\n\ndoes that mean abby totally healed me? thats complicated too. some things are just a part of me that will never disappear. joculines shocked face. stuff that happened with my parents. the aerial view of an entire nation on fire because of one little speech i gave. so ill never be \u201chealed\u201d, thats just the wrong word. mainly it just feels so good that somebody cares about me this\u00a0much.\n\ni feel so good all the time, every day. im never in a bad mood anymore, its kinda crazy. sometimes i wonder if someone like me even deserves to feel this good, but i dont even care if i dont. when im happy shes happy, and thats what makes it worth it trying to stay this\u00a0way\n\nfor the first few years we lived here, every night i could swear i saw a sword in the sky. you know like, a little constellation of stars shaped like a sword, pointing right down at me. it bugged me, always made me think of the choice i made. but after a while, id look up at the same part of the sky, and i couldnt see it anymore. id strain to see it, but it just wasnt\u00a0there.\n\nits not like the stars disappeared or anything, or rearranged themselves\u2026 it was more like my mind couldnt bring itself to do whatever it was doing to trick me into seeing it. then, kinda like the illusion of america itself, i started forgetting i could ever see it at\u00a0all\n\nso when my godhead dream self was ranting all menacingly about \u201cchoosing the sword\u201d, like ooooh, watch out! watch out for being happy because it might <span class=\"caps\">COME</span> <span class=\"caps\">BACK</span> <span class=\"caps\">TO</span> <span class=\"caps\">HAUNT</span> <span class=\"caps\">YOU</span>!! lol what a load of shit. whats going to happen to me? im going to die? of course im going to die. ill die of old age, or some other shit before that, which is the reality everybody lives\u00a0with.\n\nit doesnt matter. i made the right choice, and im not scared of anything as long as im with her. we have a good life here, and will enjoy it for however long we get to have it. our horse percy grew up to be so strong and beautiful and we love him dearly. for a while we started wondering about adopting a kid but they still dont let you do that\u00a0here.\n\nthats fine though because we decided a big beautiful horse is more than enough family for\u00a0everybody\n\nim gonna get going now. its been fun, in sort of a lopsided way. you could see me but i couldnt see you. you got to obsess over me, got to fuck with my head by trying to insist your decisions for my life are better than mine\u00a0somehow.\n\nim not mad at all though, and honestly, i appreciate all the simping youve done. im very impressed. but its my final wish for you that the moment i disappear from your life, youll begin to realize that once im gone, the only person left to impress will be yourself. peace\n\n(kiss emoji)\n\n~<span class=\"caps\">ZHEN</span>\n\n</blockquote>",

      "b": "So, believe it or not, a lot of what Zhen says here about cancel culture is actualy right. It\u2019s absolutely possible to pick out a goal (\u201churt a person I dislike\u201d, for instance) and then use a phony excuse to go about doing it. Want to hate women in the games industry? Hate women in the games industry, but insist it\u2019s about ethics in journalism somehow. Really mad that trans people exist? Make a forum where you make threads about specific public trans people so you can catalogue every individual stupid thing they do, but insist their identities aren\u2019t the reason. Want to harass someone you don\u2019t like over some personal squabble from when you were fourteen? Put together a callout post and publish a bunch of weird old blackmail material. Sometimes it really is just to get attention. It\u2019s totally possible to use social media to pursue your own goal while using some insincere pretext you can insist is your real\u00a0motivation. \n\nThe problem, of course, is that doesn\u2019t make the reverse true. Not [i]all[/i] concerns about ethics are fake, not [i]all[/i] concerns about people in a community are attempts at character assassination. This is obvious, of course. The reason those cover stories work at all is because ethics or pedophilia or toxic behaviour or whatever is because those things [i]are[/i] actually real\u00a0concerns. \n\nNow, why do I even bring that up? It\u2019s not like people are going around saying all concerns raised about them on the internet are automatically harassment, or transphobia, or stalking, right? That would be absurd. But it happens. You see people throw on another \u201clayer of bullshit\u201d, as Zhen calls it, and say that all criticism of them is automatically in such bad-faith that their critics should be reviled, without any consideration of the issue\u00a0itself. \n\nYou\u2019ll see snakes call things \u201chit pieces\u201d that aren\u2019t, or people hunting down critics of anyone in their demographic just to publicly insult them. You see people say any criticism of them is an attack on whatever minority group they decide to identify with, and that their critics need to be silenced by any needs necessary. They\u2019ll even advocate actual murder (which Zhen actually does in this story, and is praised for)! It\u2019s all just another trumped-up pretext, but this time, instead of just hurting someone you shouldn\u2019t, it\u2019s a pretext that can defend even the indefensible. And, of course, there are always people who will take full advantage of being able to do the indefensible without consequence. And that\u2019s before we even [i]touch[/i] on how all this gets used for lateral violence in and between vulnerable communities. But I\u2019m commenting here, not writing an\u00a0essay.\n\nI think one of the problems really [i]is[/i] social media, actually. There\u2019s something about social media \u2014 the rapid-fire of information, the gamification of human interaction, the platforms aiming to drive up engagement for corporate profit \u2014 that discourages people from taking the time to \u201cpenetrate the layers of bullshit\u201d and actually [i]think[/i] about the things being said. It\u2019s far, far easier to just agree with whatever rhetoric the people you like already are using than to take the time and make the effort to actually look at the substance of any given issue for yourself. \u201cAnyone opposed to X party is bad\u201d and \u201canyone who even [i]tolerates[/i] anyone I say is bad is also bad\u201d are patently absurd evaluation metrics, but they\u2019re sadly much easier metrics to use than thoughtfully engaging in each issue you care about. That takes real time and energy, so your social media content/effort output ratio is going to be much better if you take the\u00a0shortcuts.\n\nOh, and love wins. Did we\u00a0mention?",
